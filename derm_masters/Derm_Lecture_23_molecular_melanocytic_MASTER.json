    "pathogenesis": "Follows a stepwise tumor progression model: \n1. **Initiation:** Gain-of-function mutation (e.g., BRAF V600E) drives proliferation (nevus formation) but triggers oncogene-induced senescence (p16/CDKN2A mediated).\n2. **Progression:** Second hit disrupts senescence barriers (e.g., CDKN2A loss/9p21 deletion), allowing clonal expansion (intermediate lesion/melanoma in situ).\n3. **Transformation:** Additional mutations (e.g., TERT promoter) and chromosomal instability lead to invasive melanoma.\n4. **Copy Number Alterations (CNA):** As tumors evolve, they acquire non-random gains/losses (e.g., gain of 6p, loss of 6q/9p).",
