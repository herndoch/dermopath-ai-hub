Note: Pautrier microabscesses are seen in <20% of early patch stage; classic features often absent. Lymphocytes are often small/medium and cytologically bland (not cerebriform).\n- Plaque Stage: Infiltrate extends deeper into reticular dermis (beyond superficial plexus).

May resemble high-grade lymphoma or sarcoma.",
