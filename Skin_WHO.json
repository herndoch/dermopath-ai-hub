    "localization": "SCC and its precursor, actinic keratosis, are most common in chronically sun-exposed skin of the head and neck, followed by the trunk and legs (especially in women). Verrucous SCC is almost always on the genitalia, hands, and feet. SCC may arise in a site of chronic trauma/inflammation, such as a chronic ulcer, burn scar, or radiation dermatitis, known as a Marjolin ulcer. Onycholemmal carcinomas are SCCs arising from the nail bed.",
    "clinical": "SCC appears as a solitary red scaly plaque, progressing to a hyperkeratotic, often ulcerated nodule. Lesions with perineural involvement produce pain/paraesthesia. Regional lymph node involvement is the first route of metastasis. Dermoscopy shows distinctive vascular patterns: small dotted, glomerular, hairpin/looped, and/or serpentine vessels.\n\n---\n\nThe incidence of SCC is difficult to establish, but data on non-melanoma skin cancer suggest that there were an estimated 701 000 SCC tumours affecting 430 500 people in the USA in 2006 (assuming that 20% of tumours are SCC). SCC is the second most common form of skin cancer (after basal cell carcinoma) and is more common in men than in women. Most cases occur in sun-exposed skin of elderly individuals, most commonly individuals with lighter skin pigmentation.",
    "pathogenesis": "In addition to ultraviolet (UV) radiation exposure, other factors that have been implicated in the etiology of SCC include chronic immunosuppression, other forms of radiation, topical carcinogens, burn scars, chronic inflammation, sinus tracts, HPV infection, arsenic, and coal tar. Cutaneous SCC was the first occupational cancer to be identified, described in the scrotal skin of British chimney sweeps in 1775 by Percivall Pott. Patients with xeroderma pigmentosum, vitiligo, and albinism are at increased risk of SCC. A recent two-stage genome-wide association study of a large number of SCCs revealed 11 susceptibility loci. Of these, 7 are related to pigmentation: MC1R, ASIP, TYR, SLC45A2, OCA2, IRF4, and BNC2. The other 4 are involved in tumour immune evasion, apoptosis inhibition, or other oncogenic pathways: 11q23.3 (CADM1), 2p22.3, 7p21.1 (AHR), and 9q34.3 (SEC16A).\n\n---\n\nMost UV radiation–related cutaneous SCCs appear to develop through a multistep process in actinic keratoses or in fields of squamous dysplasia. Common mutations involve tumour suppressor genes such as TP53, NOTCH1, and NOTCH2. Activating mutations in genes such as HRAS and KRAS are also frequently involved. UV radiation–induced TP53 mutations probably occur early on in the process. Advanced age, immunosuppression, and environmentally determined defects in the epigenome appear to contribute to impaired elimination of precursors of malignant transformation. Cutaneous SCC probably arises from an epidermal or follicular stem cell. Recent genetic expression profile studies suggest that the differentially expressed genes CXCL8 (IL-8), MMP1, HIF1A, ITGA6, and ITGA2 are promising diagnostic and therapeutic targets.",
    "macroscopic": "See Clinical features, above.",
    "microscopic": "Although many SCCs progress from in situ lesions to progressively more deeply invasive tumours, some SCCs have no identifiable in situ precursor. Invasive SCC varies from well to poorly differentiated, with most classified as well to moderately differentiated. Some well-differentiated forms have a histological resemblance to keratoacanthoma, which is now considered to be a separate type of epidermal neoplasm. These are often termed keratoacanthoma-like SCC. Invasive tumour shows polygonal cellular profiles, pleomorphism, and varying amounts of cytoplasmic and extracytoplasmic keratin. Immunohistochemistry is generally not required, except for some poorly differentiated SCCs. Cutaneous SCC expresses p63, p40, CK5/6, MNF116 keratin, and 34βE12 keratin, with patchy EMA positivity. Unlike basal cell carcinoma, BerEP4 is negative.",
    "ancillary_studies": null,
    "differential_diagnosis": "Paget disease and melanoma in situ may mimic SCC in situ. CK7 or CEA positivity in Paget disease, and SOX10 in melanoma, are diagnostic. Well-differentiated SCC must be distinguished from pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia, syringometaplasia, inverted follicular keratosis, and inflamed verruca. Re-excision perineural invasion occurs when squamoid cells surround nerves in scars, and it can mimic SCC. Poorly differentiated or sarcomatoid SCC must be differentiated from melanoma, atypical fibroxanthoma, sarcoma, and lymphoma; a panel of immunohistochemical stains including SOX10, CK5/6, p63, and CD45 (LCA) is recommended. Colonization by melanocytes or melanoma may occur.",

    "staging": "The eighth edition of the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) / American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) TNM staging system is applicable to SCCs of head and neck origin only; it uses tumour diameter, invasion of underlying structures such as bone, and perineural invasion in nerves > 0.1 mm diameter for primary tumours and incorporates nodal and systemic involvement.",
    "prognosis_and_prediction": "Confirmed high-risk histological prognostic features are a tumour thickness of > 2 mm, Clark level IV or V invasion, perineural invasion, primary site on the ear or lip, and poor differentiation. Perineural invasion of nerves ≥ 0.1 mm in diameter correlates with higher disease-specific death rates. SCCs arising in organ transplant patients are often multiple and aggressive. Some types of SCC show distinct prognoses. Tumours with desmoplastic histology are often considered worse. Lymphoepithelial carcinoma of the skin is considered to have an intermediate metastatic potential, with a 5–10% risk of regional metastasis. Acantholytic SCC does not show a worse prognosis than typical SCC.",

    "clinical": "BCC is most common on the head and neck, followed by the trunk and extremities; the various types show different location predilections and clinical appearances. BCC has also been reported in the perianal and genital region, nail unit, palm, and sole. Dermoscopy improves the sensitivity of clinical diagnosis over visual examination from 67% to 85%.\n\n---\n\nBCC is the most common human malignancy and represents about 80% of all cancers of the skin. Incidence worldwide is rising, with an estimated 4 million new cases worldwide in 2019. The highest rates are seen in Australia, and the lowest in parts of Africa. Over the past decade, the largest increase in incidence occurred in the USA; there were unexpected increases in eastern Asia and tropical Latin America and decreases in Brazil and some African countries. Incidence is inversely related to geographical latitude combined with the pigment status of the population. Risk increases with age, and prolonged life expectancy has contributed to the rise in cases. Although BCC is more common in men overall, a dramatic increase in incidence has been seen in young women in Europe and the USA, resulting in a predominance of women in that age group. This may be due to higher use of indoor tanning and closer attention to skin health with increased medical visits.",
    "pathogenesis": "Patients who are older, are male, have sensitivity to ultraviolet (UV) radiation exposure due to light skin pigmentation, and are exposed to intense intermittent UV radiation are most likely to develop BCC. Chronic arsenic exposure may cause BCC. Radiation treatment, especially in youth, is strongly associated with BCC development. All patients with naevoid BCC syndrome (Gorlin syndrome) develop BCCs; patients with xeroderma pigmentosum, Bazex–Dupré–Christol syndrome, and Rombo syndrome are also at risk. Polymorphisms in the MC1R, ASIP, and TYR genes, which regulate melanin production, increase the risk of BCC.\n\n---\n\nThe pathogenesis of BCC involves an interplay between genetic susceptibility and sporadic UV radiation–induced mutations; BCC has the most mutations of any human cancer. Germline mutations in PTCH1 on chromosome 9q22.3-q316 are the cause of BCC in Gorlin syndrome; see section Naevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome (Gorlin syndrome). Loss of heterozygosity of PTCH1 is seen in 58–69% of sporadic BCCs; less frequently, SMO and PTCH2 are affected, and most of these are UV radiation signature mutations. Mutant PTCH1 and PTCH1 proteins are receptors for the sonic hedgehog protein, and mutant PTCH1 leads to the increased release of transmembrane protein SMO, which leads to downstream activation of the GLI1 transcriptional pathway that is involved in cell renewal, fate, and survival, and in angiogenesis. Inactivating TP53 alterations are seen in 40–65% of sporadic cases; loss of heterozygosity of this gene is mutually exclusive with PTCH1. TP53 alterations cause dysregulation of cell-cycle arrest, apoptosis, and DNA repair.",
    "macroscopic": "See the individual BCC tumour types.",
    "microscopic": "All types of BCC are characterized by basaloid tumour cells with hyperchromatic nuclei and scant cytoplasm. Apoptotic cells are common within the nests. Stromal changes include fibromyxoid change, retraction of tumour nests from stroma, calcification, and amyloid deposition. Tumour nests may be colonized by melanocytes and contain melanin pigment. Colonization by melanoma (lentigo maligna) cells has been reported. Mature keratinization is most common in nodular BCC.",

BCC shows strong expression of p40/p63 and CK5/6, diffuse BCL2 and CD10 positivity, and focal AR expression, and is negative for EMA, CEA, and CK20. The basaloid follicular neoplasms show colonizing CK20-positive Merkel cells, stromal but not tumoural CD10 expression, and peripheral BCL2 positivity. Basaloid squamous cell carcinoma is positive for EMA and negative for BerEP4, and sebaceous carcinoma is strongly positive for EMA, AR, and adipophilin, but negative for BerEP4. Merkel cell carcinoma is diffusely CK20-positive with perinuclear dot-like positivity and diffusely expresses neuroendocrine markers.

A possible explanation is that nodular melanomas acquire the necessary genetic alterations in rapid succession or in altered sequential order, so that the barriers that prevent partially transformed tumours from developing a VGP are overrun before the proliferation-inducing alterations are acquired. No specific genetic alterations, patterns of oncogenic mutations, or DNA copy-number changes distinguishing nodular melanomas from melanomas with an adjacent RGP of the same pathogenetic pathway (see #33781Table 3.05, in section Genomic landscape of melanoma) have been identified.

Compound naevi often show multiple small epithelial inclusion microcysts by slit-lamp examination.\n\n---\n\nJunctional, compound, and subepithelial melanocytic naevi account for 3–6%, 70–78%, and 15–24% of biopsied conjunctival naevi, respectively. Junctional melanocytic naevi have an M:F ratio of 2:1 and occur in childhood or adolescence.

    "macroscopic": "See Clinical features, above.",
    "microscopic": "Like common acquired naevi of the skin, the three main histological types of melanocytic naevi are junctional, compound, and subepithelial. Junctional melanocytic naevi exhibit an intraepithelial proliferation of round to oval epithelioid cells and/or oval to cuboidal, intermediate, or lymphocyte-like naevus cells. The nucleoli are usually basophilic without atypia. Mitotic figures are rare. The naevus cells can be arranged as a lentiginous proliferation or as individual, confluent, or irregular nests, without pagetoid spread. Compound melanocytic naevi contain naevus cells within the epithelium and the substantia propria, exhibiting maturation with depth. Solid and cystic surface epithelial invaginations of conjunctival epithelium (with goblet cells) are common. Mitotic activity, if present, appears in the superficial layer. Subepithelial melanocytic naevi arise in the substantia propria, with melanocytes arranged as nests. Subepithelial naevi are more likely to be amelanotic or minimally pigmented. The superficial naevus cells tend to be larger and more polygonal, whereas the deep naevus cells may display neuroid differentiation. Sporadic pleomorphism can be seen. Mitotic figures are generally absent. Solid and cystic conjunctival epithelial invaginations are seen in about half of the cases. Uncommonly, junctional and compound naevi may show disordered architectural alterations intermediate between those of conventional naevi and melanoma, such as increased diameter > 5 mm, peripheral extension of the junctional component, asymmetry, poor circumscription, irregular and confluent junctional nesting, and focal pagetoid spread. Aberrant alterations in the subepithelial component may include diminished or even reversed maturation, nodule formation, and occasional mitotic activity. On occasion, naevi may be inflamed with prominent lymphocytic infiltrates, resembling halo naevi in the skin.",
    "ancillary_studies": "Most conjunctival naevi are positive for HMB45 in the superficial areas only, with homogeneous deeper staining for melan-A, SOX10, and MITF. They are usually negative for cyclin D1 and PRAME, whereas most conjunctival melanomas are positive for these markers.",
    "differential_diagnosis": "For junctional melanocytic naevi, the main differential is the conjunctival melanocytic intraepithelial lesion (see section Conjunctival melanocytic intraepithelial lesions). Junctional melanocytic lesions in an adult should be assumed to be conjunctival melanocytic intraepithelial lesions until proved otherwise. Conjunctival melanoma usually exhibits a larger size, aberrant architecture such as confluent and hypercellular nesting, cytological atypia, and greater mitotic activity. Melanoma cells are larger than naevus cells and show conspicuous nuclear atypia. Adjoining melanoma in situ may be present.

MITF is a transcription factor and member of the MiT/TFE family, which also contains TFEB, TFE3, and TFEC and acts as the master regulator of melanocytic differentiation. The actin gene involved in the ACT::MITF translocation can be ACTB or ACTG1. The large C-terminal MITF fragment of the fusion protein retains its transcriptional activation domain, suggesting hyperactive MITF function. MITF::CREM fusions are an alternative driver and may drive expression of the non-rearranged MITF allele, resulting in hyperactive MITF function. CREM is a member of the CREB1/ATF1/CREM family of transcription factors that regulate diverse cellular processes, including transcription of MITF. The N-terminal MITF portion of the fusion protein lacks its transcriptional activation domain, whereas the transcriptional activation domain is preserved in the CREM fragment, analogous to the EWSR1::ATF1 and EWSR1::CREB1 fusions found in clear cell sarcoma.",

    "related_terminology": "Acceptable: Paget disease of breast; Paget disease of the nipple; breast carcinoma involving nipple skin.",
    "subtypes": "None",
    "localization": "MPD involves the nipple and areola; in advanced cases, it may extend to the adjacent skin of the breast. One breast is typically involved, but there may be both synchronous and metachronous involvement. A supernumerary nipple (or ectopic breast tissue adjacent to a supernumerary nipple) can also very rarely be involved [[WHO Classification of Tumours Editorial Board. Breast tumours. Lyon (France): International Agency for Research on Cancer; 2019. (WHO classification of tumours series, 5th ed.; vol. 2). https://publications.iarc.who.int/581.]].",
    "clinical": "There is usually an eczematous scaly or crusted lesion confined to the nipple or areola, sometimes associated with ulceration or inversion of the nipple and discharge. Rare cases are pigmented, resembling a melanocytic lesion.\n\n---\n\nMPD accounts for 1–4% of all breast carcinomas. It almost exclusively affects women; < 1% of reported cases occurred in men. The age range is 26–88 years. About 10–28% of cases are incidental findings in the nipple in mastectomy specimens, particularly in prophylactic mastectomies in patients with BRCA mutations.",
    "pathogenesis": "Most cases are associated with an underlying mammary carcinoma.\n\n---\n\nMore than 95% of cases are associated with an underlying mammary cancer, representing a retrograde extension of the breast carcinoma into the epidermis in a contiguous fashion through spread along the lactiferous ducts. Cases without underlying carcinoma have been postulated to originate from Toker cells, a hypothesis supported by the observation of rare cases in which the Paget cells are genetically different from the neoplastic cells that form an underlying breast carcinoma.",
    "macroscopic": "The nipple may appear normal or (more commonly) erythematous.",
    "microscopic": "The neoplastic cells (Paget cells) have abundant weakly eosinophilic or pale-staining cytoplasm and large vesicular nuclei. They are scattered in the epidermis (pagetoid spread) in the form of solitary units, clusters, or (rarely) acinar/glandular structures. Skin adnexa can also be involved. Paget cells contain intracellular mucin in 40% of cases, and they may contain melanin due to phagocytosis (a possible diagnostic pitfall). The epidermis is often hyperkeratotic and acanthotic, especially in longstanding lesions. An underlying carcinoma (most commonly a high-grade invasive carcinoma) may be present in the specimen. Paget cells usually have an immunoprofile identical to that of the underlying carcinoma. They express low-molecular-weight cytokeratins (with CAM5.2), CK7, human milk fat globule, and mammary-type apomucin EMA. As many as 90% of cases are positive for ERBB2 (HER2). Approximately half of the cases express GCDFP-15. There is variable positivity for polyclonal CEA. AR has been found in most cases; ER and/or PR are present in approximately 10–30% of cases. Paget cells are negative for CK20. Rare CK7-negative cases retain expression of GATA3.",
    "ancillary_studies": null,
    "differential_diagnosis": "Clinically, MPD must be distinguished from eczema and nipple adenoma. The histological differential diagnosis includes spongiotic dermatoses, candidiasis/dermatophytes, squamous cell carcinoma in situ (Bowen disease), and superficial spreading melanoma. Rare cases of clinically pigmented MPD contain melanin pigment, usually in isolated dendritic melanocytes, thus raising the possibility of melanoma. These isolated cells express melanocytic markers (melan-A [MART1], SOX10), while the surrounding Paget cells express CK7, EMA, and ERBB2 (HER2). In some cases, hyperplasia of Toker cells, a normal component of the nipple, may present a diagnostic dilemma.",
    "cytology": "Some authors have suggested the use of imprint cytology diagnosis, although this is not a widely used technique.",
    "diagnostic_molecular_pathology": "There is no known association with a specific gene mutation, although it has been suggested that the MSI1/mTOR pathway may drive the pathogenesis of mammary and extramammary Paget disease. Genetically, Paget cells are similar to the underlying carcinoma cells in most cases.",
    "essential_and_desirable_diagnostic_criteria": "Essential: large intraepidermal atypical cells with abundant pale cytoplasm and large nuclei with prominent nucleoli; single cells or small clusters typically leaving a single layer of basal keratinocytes; positivity for low-molecular-weight cytokeratins and ERBB2.",
    "staging": "If no underlying carcinoma or ductal carcinoma in situ is present, MPD is staged as Tis according to the eighth edition of the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) TNM classification. If there is invasive carcinoma, it is staged according to the invasive component [[Brierley JD, Gospodarowicz MK, Wittekind C, editors. TNM classification of malignant tumours. 8th ed. Oxford (UK): Wiley-Blackwell; 2017.]].",
    "prognosis_and_prediction": "The prognosis of MPD is determined by the features of the associated mammary carcinoma and the stage of the disease. The 5-year overall survival rates are 94–98% and 73–93% in the presence of ductal carcinoma in situ and underlying invasive carcinoma, respectively. Detection of invasion from the epidermis does not seem to correlate with an impaired prognosis.",

    "microscopic": "Fibroadenoma is a well-circumscribed neoplasm composed of round or elongated, often branching and anastomosing glandular structures surrounded by a paucicellular stroma containing bland spindled or stellate cells, showing low or practically no mitotic activity. When the glandular lumina maintain round or oval configurations, the image is that of a pericanalicular growth pattern, whereas abundant stroma compressing the glandular elements into slit-like structures produces an intracanalicular pattern. Phyllodes tumour shows a growth pattern with leaf-like projections into glandular lumina. The stroma is usually hypercellular, typically with periglandular condensation; cellularity commonly varies within a given neoplasm. Three categories are delineated: benign, low-grade, and high-grade; the grade is defined by stromal atypia. Most vulvar phyllodes tumours are either benign or low-grade; high-grade tumours are extremely rare. Rare features in these tumours include mammary-type ductal lesions, hyperplasia of myoepithelial cells, pseudoangiomatous stromal hyperplasia (PASH), various types of metaplasia in the glandular component and stroma, and lactation-like changes.",

Generally, phyllodes tumours have more-cellular stroma (with variation within a lesion), less regular outlines, and leaf-like projections. Focal connection to the epidermal surface with numerous plasma cells may resemble syringocystadenoma papilliferum. Fibroepithelial foci resembling fibroadenoma may rarely be found in other complex lesions of anogenital mammary-like glands. Fibrocystic disease and other lesions with prominent ductal hyperplasia may be differential diagnoses in a limited specimen. Lactation-like change (secretory hyperplasia) must not be confused with malignancy; the presence of intracytoplasmic vacuoles and intraluminal secretion is the clue to the diagnosis.

    "definition": "Sebaceous carcinoma is a malignant epithelial neoplasm demonstrating sebaceous differentiation. Depending on their anatomical location, sebaceous carcinomas are divided into extraocular and periocular (eyelid) sebaceous carcinomas.",
    "related_terminology": "Acceptable: Meibomian gland carcinoma (periocular).",
    "subtypes": "None",
    "localization": "Sebaceous carcinoma can occur anywhere but shows a predilection for the head and neck and occurs most commonly around the eyelids: 75% of all cases arise in a periocular (eyelid) location. They may involve the conjunctival and/or skin surface. Extraocular sebaceous carcinomas occur most commonly on the skin of the head and neck, followed by the trunk, genitals, and extremities. Rare cases occur in the oral cavity, salivary gland, lung, and breast.",
    "clinical": "Patients with sebaceous carcinoma present with a tan-pink-yellow, firm, occasionally nodular lesion measuring 10–30 mm. Periocular sebaceous carcinoma may be mistaken clinically for benign inflammatory or neoplastic conditions, leading to a delay in diagnosis and to higher morbidity and mortality. Pagetoid sebaceous carcinoma may resemble chronic blepharoconjunctivitis.\n\n---\n\nSebaceous carcinoma develops in older adults, with no sex predilection. The median age at diagnosis is 73 years. The estimated incidence rate per 1 million person-years is approximately 2 cases in White populations, 1 among Asians and Pacific Islanders, and 0.5 in Black populations. Asians and Pacific Islanders appear to be more predisposed to develop a periocular sebaceous carcinoma than other populations.",
    "pathogenesis": "Risk factors include prior radiotherapy, sun exposure, viral infections (HIV and HPV), immunosuppression, and Muir–Torre syndrome, although periocular tumours have almost no association with Muir–Torre syndrome or mismatch repair defects.\n\n---\n\nExtraocular sebaceous carcinomas can be grouped into three molecular-genetic classes based on whether they show an ultraviolet (UV) radiation signature, a paucimutational signature, or a microsatellite instability (MSI) signature. Sebaceous carcinomas with a UV radiation signature carry the highest frequency of mutations, including TP53, RREB1, and NOTCH family mutations. MSI-related sebaceous carcinomas more commonly carry HRAS and KRAS mutations together with TP53, RB1, RREB1, and NOTCH family member mutations. Although defective mismatch repair may be seen in some extraocular sebaceous carcinomas, most of these mutations are somatically acquired, rather than related to Muir–Torre syndrome. Finally, paucimutational sebaceous carcinomas show fewer mutations, but HRAS and NOTCH1 mutations are observed. Periocular sebaceous carcinomas often harbour mutations in TP53, RB1, NOTCH family genes, and ZNF750, as well as gain of the MYC locus. A small subset of cases are related to high-risk HPV infection, and these occur in younger patients, with fewer recurrences.",
    "macroscopic": "See Clinical features, above.",
    "microscopic": "Well-differentiated sebaceous carcinoma consists of lobules of polygonal tumour cells with atypical, oval vesicular nuclei and abundant intracytoplasmic vacuoles that impart a foamy appearance and impinge on the nucleus, creating scalloping. Central comedo-type necrosis may be seen. More poorly differentiated tumours show a higher N:C ratio, nuclear pleomorphism, prominent nucleoli, basophilic cytoplasm with fewer intracellular vacuoles, and brisk mitotic activity. Sebaceous carcinoma may show basaloid, squamoid (often with keratin pearl formation), spindle cell / sarcomatoid, or neuroendocrine (rippled or organoid growth) features. Invasive tumours can adopt various architectural patterns, including well-circumscribed lobules with pushing borders and variable comedonecrosis, papillary architecture, and highly infiltrative cords; combinations of these patterns are often observed. Of note, whereas sebaceous carcinomas with a UV radiation signature tend to be more poorly differentiated, MSI-related tumours show more well-differentiated histopathological features. Approximately 60% of cases carry an intraepithelial component (pagetoid spread) with extension along and partial replacement of pre-existing pilosebaceous units in the skin, and pseudoglands of Henle in the conjunctiva. Notably, intraepithelial skip lesions may also occur, and sebaceous carcinoma in situ (restricted to the epithelium) may be encountered.",
    "ancillary_studies": "Sebaceous carcinoma shows immunoreactivity for pancytokeratin (and also CK7), adipophilin, EMA, BerEP4, AR, p40, and p63. EMA labelling may enhance the cytoplasmic vacuolization of the tumour cells, but it is often only positive in well-differentiated tumours and lacks specificity. Adipophilin is a more sensitive and specific marker of sebaceous differentiation. Positivity for CD10, DOG1, KIT (CD117), p16, p53, perforin, and factor XIIIa has also been reported in sebaceous carcinoma.",
    "differential_diagnosis": "Sebaceous carcinoma should be excluded when examining basaloid, squamoid, and clear cell epithelial tumours in periocular locations.

The content of the cysts is basophilic and orthokeratotic keratin, similar to the keratin present in the infundibulum of hair follicles. Sometimes the epithelial lining of these cysts is similar to the epithelium of the sebaceous duct, resembling steatocystoma. Finally, some cystic structures of trichoadenoma may be lined by an eosinophilic epithelium with peripheral palisading on a basement membrane; the cyst wall cells show pale pink cytoplasm and keratinization without a previous granular layer resulting in eosinophilic compact orthokeratotic keratin, resembling tiny trichilemmal cysts. Some solid epithelial aggregates of infundibular epithelium are also present in most lesions. Foreign body granulomas are frequently observed in the vicinity of ruptured cystic structures. The stroma of trichoadenoma is much less abundant than the epithelial component and consists of a densely vascularized fibrohistiocytic component and fibrillary collagen.

    "ancillary_studies": "Scattered CK20-positive Merkel cells are detected in the epithelial aggregates of trichoadenoma. Immunoprofile studies for cytokeratins support the hypothesis that trichoadenoma differentiates mainly towards the follicular infundibulum and follicular bulge of the outer root sheath.

    "differential_diagnosis": "With an inadequate and too-superficial biopsy, differential diagnosis with syringoma, columnar trichoblastoma (formerly desmoplastic trichoepithelioma), and microcystic adnexal carcinoma may be impossible, and a larger and deeper sample should be requested. Syringoma is composed of small ductal structures lined by two layers of epithelial cells embedded in a sclerotic stroma. Infundibular cysts are less numerous in syringoma than in trichoadenoma, and in difficult cases, immunostains for EMA and CEA demonstrate that ductal structures of syringoma express these two markers in the luminal border of the ducts, whereas infundibular cysts of trichoadenoma are negative. Columnar trichoblastoma (formerly desmoplastic trichoepithelioma) with abundant infundibular cysts may resemble trichoadenoma, but it is mostly composed of elongated thin cords of basaloid follicular germinative cells expressing PHLDA1 and a prominent desmoplastic stroma. Microcystic adnexal carcinoma is a malignant and poorly circumscribed neoplasm that often extends to subcutaneous tissue. In superficial areas, the histopathological picture may be similar to that of trichoadenoma, because there are numerous small infundibular cysts, but microcystic adnexal carcinoma is also composed of small round solid aggregates of pale cells and elongated tubular structures in deeper areas. Perineural involvement is also frequently seen in these deeper areas of microcystic adnexal carcinoma.",

Giant lesions and perforating tumours due to the transepidermal elimination of neoplastic cells have been reported. Approximately 5% of patients have multiple pilomatricomas, usually in association with genetic syndromes (see below), although rare non-syndromic cases have been described.\n\n---\n\nPilomatricoma is common, accounting for about 1% of all pathologically diagnosed benign skin lesions. It is the most common non-melanocytic cutaneous tumour excised in children. Pilomatricomas occur across a wide age range (3 months to 93 years) with two peaks of incidence, the first in children and adolescents (between the first and second decade of life) and the second in adults and elderly patients. Nearly half of all cases are diagnosed during the first two decades of life. Most studies have noted a slight female predominance.",

Matrical cells often harbour trisomy of chromosome 18, which carries the antiapoptotic gene BCL2, suggesting that the BCL2 oncoprotein may play a role in the growth and differentiation of pilomatricoma.

These peripheral matrical cells keratinize towards shadow (or ghost or mummified) cells. In rare examples, acantholysis between matrical cells has been described. Shadow cells show distinct borders, eosinophilic cytoplasm, and an empty space where the nucleus was once located. Aggregates of shadow cells show yellow-orange staining and are refractile under polarized light. The transition from matrical cells to shadow cells occurs via intermediate cells characterized by a small, pyknotic, basophilic nucleus and pale cytoplasm. The ratio of matrical cells to shadow cells decreases with increasing age of the lesion. Pilomatricomas are often cystic (most commonly those associated with Gardner syndrome). Calcification and ossification occur in longstanding lesions; in some of these, very few shadow cells remain. The surrounding dermis is fibrotic and often contains foreign body granulomas around shadow cells and calcium deposits. Rare cases are connected to the surface epidermis. Pathological patterns include pigmented and proliferating pilomatricoma (consisting predominantly of mitotically active matrical cells).

Immunohistochemistry can also be helpful; EGFR (HER1), podoplanin (recognized by D2-40), and p63 are more frequently expressed in primary tumours than in metastatic adenocarcinomas. A panel of several antibodies may have some utility in the distinction; metastatic breast carcinoma is adipophilin+, ER−, PR−, ERBB2 (HER2)+, CK5/6+/− (weak), and mammaglobin+/− (weak), whereas primary apocrine carcinoma is adipophilin−, ER+, PR+/−, ERBB2 (HER2)−, CK5/6+/− (strong and diffuse), and mammaglobin+/− (strong and diffuse).

    "pathogenesis": "Unknown\n\n---\n\nAbout 60% of AdCCs harbour MYB gene activations, either through MYB chromosomal abnormalities or (less commonly) by MYB::NFIB fusion. The MYB::NFIB fusion oncogene, which results from the recurrent chromosomal translocation t(6;9)(q22-23;p23-24), activates the transcription of genes involved in cell-cycle control, DNA repair, and apoptosis. The t(6;9) translocation appears to be tumour-type–specific; it has been identified in AdCCs arising in various anatomical locations. In rare cases, alterations of the MYBL1 gene have been found.",

    "microscopic": "AdCCs are characterized by a mixture of cribriform, tubular, and solid patterns forming variably shaped nodules in the dermis and/or subcutis. The essential diagnostic feature is the coexistence of true small bilayered ducts and pseudocysts. The true ductal structures are usually sparse, have small round lumina, and are composed of inner epithelial cells with uniform round nuclei (sometimes with small nucleoli) surrounded by an outer layer of basal/myoepithelial cells. Intraluminal secretion can be seen. The pseudocystic structures are usually larger than ducts, and they contain abundant basophilic mucinous material that stains positively with Alcian blue at pH 2.5 and/or hyalinized eosinophilic material that gives a positive PAS reaction. The pseudocysts are often surrounded on the luminal edge by a thin layer of hyalinized connective tissue. The solid areas are composed of small basaloid cells with hyperchromatic, slightly angulated nuclei and scant cytoplasm. Mitotic activity is typically low in AdCC, and cellular pleomorphism is usually not a feature, although rare cases with high-grade atypia have been reported. Perineural invasion is a common feature, whereas intraneural invasion is rare. The stroma is hyalinized and paucicellular. Occasional tumours display myxoid change, and fibrosis may be seen. Rare changes include cystic alteration, papillary formation, spilling or pinching off of epithelial or myoepithelial cells into a prominent myxoid stroma, and high-grade transformation.",

The basaloid and myoepithelial cells display nuclear staining for SOX10. EMA, CEA, and CK15 label the luminal cells surrounding the true ducts. The myoepithelial component is highlighted by staining for SMA, p63, and calponin. Most tumours express MYB, and all tumours are positive for KIT (CD117).",
    "differential_diagnosis": "Cutaneous secretory carcinoma consists of back-to-back tubules and microcysts with conspicuous intraluminal secretions and shows a distinctive positivity for S100, mammaglobin, STAT5A, and NTRK. Adenoid basal cell carcinoma is distinguished from AdCC by its lack of true ductal structures with myoepithelial cells, the presence of peripheral palisading of neoplastic cells and retraction artefact (often associated with stromal mucin), and at least focal areas of conventional basal cell carcinoma. Cribriform carcinoma is composed of more eosinophilic cells; lacks myoepithelial cells; and focally manifests solid areas and peculiar thin, thread-like intraluminal bridging strands. Rare cases of spiradenoma and spiradenocylindroma display areas resembling AdCC by virtue of a cribriform pattern; homogeneous, eosinophilic, or granular basophilic material; and/or ductal structures with a recognizable peripheral myoepithelial cell layer. The proportion of the AdCC-like pattern varies from 5% to 30% of the tumour volume; therefore, the identification of typical areas of spiradenoma/cylindroma, as well as the absence of nuclear pleomorphism, perineural growth, and increased mitotic activity, facilitates the recognition of this spiradenoma/spiradenocylindroma with an AdCC-like pattern.

    "microscopic": "The stereotypical presentation is that of neoplastic cells arranged in nests, strands, or individual units floating in lakes of extracellular mucin, sometimes separated by variably thick fibrous septa. The histopathological spectrum of primary cutaneous mucinous carcinoma is wide, and it is analogous to that seen in its mammary counterparts, with at least two distinguishable patterns: a more common pure tumour, in which extracellular mucin constitutes > 90%; and a rare mixed form, in which there is an invasive ductal component in addition to the mucinous element. The floating neoplastic epithelial cells are usually relatively monomorphic, although some tumours may show substantial nuclear pleomorphism. Mitoses are generally scarce. An essential feature, which should be looked for, is an in situ component; it is detected in most cases (60–70%) and defines the neoplasm as primary cutaneous. In situ lesions usually constitute the minor moiety, and they include (using mammary pathology terminology) ductal hyperplasia, atypical ductal hyperplasia, and ductal carcinoma in situ (cribriform, micropapillary, papillary, and solid), occurring individually or (more rarely) in combination. Some tumours are solid, have a minimal mucinous component, and express neuroendocrine markers (similarly to endocrine mucin-producing sweat gland carcinoma).",
    "ancillary_studies": "The in situ component may be highlighted by staining for myoepithelial markers (including p63 and calponin). The epithelial neoplastic cells express low-molecular-weight cytokeratins, EMA, CEA, E-cadherin, GATA3, MYB, and GCDFP-15. ER and PR are expressed in most cases. The typical CK7+/CK20− phenotype can sometimes be useful in the differential diagnosis with metastatic lesions. Neuroendocrine differentiation can be encountered in cutaneous mucinous carcinomas of both pure and mixed types, without a prominent solid component.",
    "differential_diagnosis": "Because histologically identical neoplasms can occur in other organs, primary cutaneous mucinous carcinoma must be differentiated from a metastasis or direct invasion from an underlying extracutaneous neoplasm. The presence of an in situ component qualifies the tumour as primary cutaneous; however, its absence does not necessarily imply an extracutaneous origin, because disrupted myoepithelial cells may no longer be identifiable during disease progression. For such cases, a full clinical workup is needed to establish the origin. Potential pitfalls related to in situ lesions include mammary carcinoma originating from an intradermal lactiferous duct (which could be indistinguishable from a primary cutaneous lesion) and the misinterpretation of normal-looking pre-existing ducts and glands as an in situ lesion. Localization of the tumour on the chest wall and axilla is a strong indicator of mammary origin, whereas microscopic identification of dirty necrosis (disruption of cells resulting in cellular debris) and goblet cell differentiation is a clue to intestinal origin. Rare cases of primary mucinous carcinoma with numerous signet-ring cells, lesions associated with extramammary Paget disease, and lesions in which the mucinous component is scant also pose particular pitfalls. For lesions in which the mucinous component is scant, serial sections or other blocks may reveal the typical mucinous appearance.",

    "microscopic": "EMPSGC typically grows as one or more well-demarcated, expansile nodules with cystic, solid, papillary, pseudopapillary, or cribriform architecture. Tumour cells are polygonal to round, small to intermediate-sized ductal cells, about 1.5 times the size of sweat gland luminal ductal cells. They have amphophilic or bluish cytoplasm and round to oval nuclei with finely stippled chromatin and inconspicuous nucleoli. Mild cytological pleomorphism can be noted in some cases. Small amounts of intracellular and extracellular mucin can be demonstrated by mucicarmine or PAS staining. EMPSGC is frequently seen within dilated eccrine ducts as it spreads between the benign luminal ductal epithelium and the myoepithelial layer. At this (the earliest) stage, the tumour represents carcinoma in situ. Careful evaluation is needed so as not to mistake such a lesion for hidrocystoma. As EMPSGC grows, tumour cells begin to fill the ductal lumina, forming papillae, cribriform arrangements, and/or solid nests, which later become large expansile nodules. The nodules show variable proportions of solid, cystic, papillary, or pseudopapillary architecture. The myoepithelial rim around the larger tumour nests becomes incomplete or lost entirely, consistent with invasive carcinoma with pushing invasion. An infiltrating growth pattern is not seen. The presence of infiltrating tumour nests associated with pools of stromal mucin indicates progression to invasive mucinous adenocarcinoma. Mitotic activity is low, and the Ki-67 proliferation index is seldom greater than 5–10%. Tumour necrosis is usually absent. Atypical patterns with increased size, pleomorphism, solid growth, and increased mitotic activity can be encountered. Lesions with even the smallest component of mucinous adenocarcinoma should be diagnosed as invasive mucinous carcinoma.",

Markers such as p63 or calponin can highlight the myoepithelial layer at the carcinoma in situ stage. EMA shows stronger staining of the surface of the luminal cells.

The remnants of the benign neoplasm are either juxtaposed with the malignant tissue or blend gradually with it. The malignant component shows heterogeneity from case to case and can display the following patterns: adenocarcinoma (apocrine), myoepithelial carcinoma, carcinoma NOS, and sarcomatoid (metaplastic) carcinoma. Adenocarcinoma is composed of sheets of tumour cells arranged in nodules, with glands and papillary structures in which apocrine secretion can be identified. In the absence of convincing apocrine features, the malignant component may be referred to as a carcinoma NOS. Myoepithelial carcinoma is usually diagnosed in lesions in which the pre-existing apocrine mixed tumour displays prominent myoepithelial cell differentiation (i.e. hyaline cell–rich tumours). Like the benign residual tumour cells, the malignant myoepithelial cells have eccentric nuclei and abundant eosinophilic hyaline cytoplasm but display marked pleomorphism, atypical mitoses, and (sometimes) vascular involvement. Sarcomatoid (metaplastic) carcinoma is characterized by a gradual transition from a carcinomatous element to sarcomatoid tissue, which has the appearance of pleomorphic or spindle cell sarcoma NOS or of chondrosarcoma [[Kazakov DV, Michal M, Kacerovska D, et al., editors.

In some cases, the benign neoplasm may have been completely overgrown by the evolving malignant neoplasm, but it is likely that tumours of different lineages were also included in these reports. Approximately 10% of cases of benign apocrine mixed tumour show focal atypical cytological features, including enlarged hyperchromatic cells and multinucleated bizarre cells, which are mainly seen in the areas with squamous cell metaplasia, among hyaline cells, or in foci of oxyphilic metaplasia. However, most of these lesions manifest benign architectural features and follow a benign course. An important diagnostic pitfall is the presence of intravascular tumour deposits in an otherwise benign apocrine mixed tumour, which occurs in 1–2% of the neoplasms.

There is no completely sensitive and specific immunohistochemical marker for porocarcinoma. Immunohistochemical expression of the fusion partner NUT has been reported, with a sensitivity of 50–58%.

Focal enlarged, atypical-appearing p53-positive cuticular cells can be observed in some poromas. Porocarcinomas, as opposed to poromas, often show diffuse or focal loss of RB1 expression. Poorly differentiated porocarcinoma may be difficult to classify as such, because the typical composition of poroid cells and cuticular cells is often no longer recognizable. Single-cell necrosis in other neoplasms may result in pseudoductal structures that can mimic porocarcinoma. In such cases, the distinction can be made by using CEA and EMA to highlight true ductal structures. Porocarcinoma can manifest variable histopathological features (squamous cell areas, clear cells, etc.) that raise a broad histopathological differential diagnosis. Identifying a parent lesion (i.e. a pre-existing poroma or porocarcinoma in situ) is the best way to avoid misinterpretation in such cases.

In a meta-analysis of 453 cases, the metastatic rate was 31%; of the metastatic cases, 57% displayed regional lymph node metastasis. A high mitotic index (> 8 mitoses/mm2) and lymphovascular invasion are strongly predictive of death; a high mitotic index also correlates with lymph node involvement. The gross size of the tumour has no significant relationship with prognosis, but a tumour depth of > 7 mm predicts death or lymph node involvement.

The neoplasm is composed of multiple interconnected solid nests of epithelial cells with round or oval, hyperchromatic nuclei; inconspicuous or absent nucleoli; granular chromatin; and scant eosinophilic cytoplasm. In addition to the solid areas, there are also small round lumina that are either empty or filled with an eosinophilic substance that gives a homogeneously positive PAS reaction, giving rise to a cribriform pattern. The ratio of solid to cribriform areas varies both within a given neoplasm and among tumours. Common features are larger ductal spaces (sometimes with decapitation secretion); intraluminal micropapillary projections; and thin, thread-like intraluminal bridging strands. Mitotic figures, especially atypical ones, are rare. Individual necrotic cells or foci of necrosis can be evident focally. The small, satellite-like aggregates, composed of a single cell to three or four cells, usually display more-pronounced cytological atypia and nuclear hyperchromasia than the main tumour bulk, but perineural or lymphovascular invasion is not a feature. The stroma is scant and fibrotic, often containing nodular lymphoid aggregates at the periphery of the neoplasm. The neoplastic cells are positive for various cytokeratins (MNF116, AE1/AE3, CAM5.2, CK5/6, and CK7) and BerEP4, and variably positive for KIT. Staining for CEA and EMA highlights the ductal component. CK20, GCDFP-15, CD15, CD31, GATA3, and PR are negative. Immunoreactivity for S100 and p63 is variable. ER can be positive, as can ERBB2.

Coexpression of S100, mammaglobin, STAT5A, and pan-TRK helps to distinguish the neoplasm from cribriform tumour.

Secretory carcinoma has the characteristic secretion contents in the lumen. The primary importance of this entity is its similarity to adenocarcinomas metastatic to the skin. Distinguishing primary from metastatic cutaneous adenocarcinoma may present a diagnostic conundrum. Adnexal adenocarcinoma NOS may resemble skin metastasis, typically from the breast, lung, gastrointestinal tract, kidney, or ovary [[Scolyer RA, Thompson JF, Mahar A, et al. Metastatic tumors involving the skin. In: Busam KJ, editor. Dermatopathology. 2nd ed. London (UK): Elsevier; 2015. pp. 674–88.]].

Half to 75% of the cases of hidradenoma have CRTC1::MAML2 fusion, and CRTC3::MAML2 fusions occur more rarely.",
    "macroscopic": "See Clinical features, above.",
    "microscopic": "Hidradenomas are well-circumscribed dermal neoplasms that may extend into the subcutaneous tissue. Most hidradenomas are solid lobular proliferations, but some contain large cystic spaces filled with homogeneous eosinophilic material. The majority of hidradenomas are composed of pale or clear cells (hence the synonym clear cell hidradenoma). However, other cell types, including polygonal, mucinous, squamoid, oxyphilic/oncocytic, and epidermoid cells, can also be present. The proportion of various cell types and their combinations vary from case to case. The characteristic cytoplasmic clarity is due to abundant intracellular glycogen. The nuclei are small, round, and (usually) eccentrically located. In some examples of hidradenoma, polygonal and epidermoid cells are the most prominent component. Mucinous cells usually appear in small groups and can be recognized by the presence of ample granular bluish cytoplasm. When polygonal cells with ample eosinophilic cytoplasm predominate, hidradenomas have an appearance reminiscent of oncocytoma. Squamoid cells have abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm and are separated by well-defined intercellular bridges; some may keratinize individually and appear as dyskeratotic keratinocytes. Areas of ductal and glandular differentiation are usually present, even in solid neoplasms. These structures are lined by cuboidal cells that elaborate an eosinophilic luminal cuticle. In some cases, glandular structures lined by columnar cells with evidence of secretion by decapitation in the luminal border are also seen. Myoepithelial cells are not present in ductal or glandular structures of hidradenoma. The stroma in hidradenoma is characteristically hyalinized, separating epithelial islands; in lesions of long evolution, this hyalinization may be very marked, leaving only small aggregates of neoplastic cells. Focal cytological atypia can be encountered (hidradenoma with atypical features). Immunostaining for EMA and CEA highlights ductal differentiation; p40, p63, CK5/6, and AE1/AE3 are strongly and diffusely expressed, whereas S100 and SMA are usually negative.",

    "differential_diagnosis": "Poroid hidradenoma has two cell types (poroid and cuticular), both of which are very different from the cells of hidradenoma. In poroid hidradenoma, tubular structures are only seen in the areas of cuticular cells. Like other poromas, poroid hidradenoma frequently shows areas of necrosis en masse. Trichilemmomas consist of pale or clear cells showing signs of trichilemmal differentiation; they often expand the follicular infundibulum and exhibit peripheral palisading surrounded by a thick and prominent basement membrane. In contrast, hidradenoma can connect with pre-existing infundibular structures, but the neoplastic epithelial islands form solid aggregates in the dermis and subcutis. Hidradenomas with a predominantly solid pattern must be distinguished from glomus tumour that shows SMA positivity. Hidradenoma must also be distinguished from a cutaneous metastasis of renal carcinoma, which is characterized by an abundant blood supply, numerous atypical mitoses and areas of necrosis (of both individual neoplastic cells and groups of cells), and extracellular blood lakes. A combination of PAX8 and CAIX staining may be used to solve the differential diagnosis. A particular diagnostic pitfall is posed by cases of histologically benign hidradenomas with lymphatic involvement or evidence of a tumour in a regional lymph node diagnosed simultaneously with the cutaneous primary. Histopathologically, such tumours are well circumscribed and show a lobular and cystic architecture, ductal differentiation, and a hyalinized stroma. There is no significant cytological atypia. Mitoses are rare and necrosis is absent. The lymph nodes show an essentially identical proliferation, with more cellular and extensive cystic changes containing pink amorphous material. Because follow-up of such cases has not revealed any adverse outcomes, it has been suggested that these tumours constitute so-called benign metastases. However, a longer follow-up and more cases are needed to prove or disprove this theory. Complete excision is recommended.",

They arise in the distal nail bed or occasionally in the proximal nail fold; in the latter, they present as paronychia. Solitary, multiple, eruptive, and familial forms occur. Patients often present with a painful nodule with subungual hyperkeratosis and/or nail spicule. Unlike keratoacanthoma at other sites, they may have an earlier onset, rarely resolve spontaneously, and often require surgery. Bone erosion or osteolysis may occur. Subungual keratoacanthoma and STIP are indistinguishable histologically, although their occurrence in young women should trigger a search for possible incontinentia pigmenti. STIPs correlate with late-stage, verrucous disease and typically arise between the ages of 15 and 35 years; such lesions may present more subtly, with nail dystrophy or destruction or paronychia, which may be the sole manifestation of the disease. Subungual hyperkeratosis may precede tumours. Although some lesions involute, the extreme pain associated with these tumours has driven patients to amputation as treatment, although retinoids have been used successfully more recently.\n\n---\n\nSubungual keratoacanthoma is a rare tumour that occurs most commonly in middle-aged, light-skinned individuals, in a slightly younger age group than keratoacanthoma elsewhere.

However, distinguishing features include a more vertical orientation, multiple and often clustered dyskeratotic keratinocytes (often numerous in areas of hyperkeratosis), and fewer eosinophils and neutrophils. They may lack fibrosis at their bases. Rarely, calcifying keratinocytes and corneocytes may be observed. The higher expression of p53 and Ki-67 in subungual SCC can be useful in distinguishing it from subungual keratoacanthoma. In STIP, the tumour may displace the nail plate, leading to dystrophy.

These lesions typically present with longitudinal erythronychia, a reddish nail streak and/or yellowish discolouration, sometimes beginning in a wedge-shaped contour in the distal matrix. Splinter haemorrhage is also common, as is distal subungual hyperkeratosis, often forming a spicule. These are as large as 5–6 mm in width and are often more centrally placed. Distal nail plate splitting, fissuring or notching, and onycholysis can occur. Punctate haemorrhage has also been described. Onychopapilloma can show different patterns, including pigmented (often due to melanocytic activation) and those presenting with leukonychia.\n\n---\n\nOnychopapilloma is a relatively common and probably underreported benign epithelial proliferation of the nail unit; its incidence has not been formally studied.",

Diagnostic features may remain attached to the nail plate during nail plate avulsion or reflection, which also often avulses the superficial nail unit epithelium. Proximally, there may be slight hyperplasia of nail matrix epithelium, and so-called matrical metaplasia of the nail bed, consisting of a pattern of maturation similar to matrix, with retained keratinocyte nuclei over eosinophilic superficial keratinocytes. More distally, there is nail bed hyperplasia (which is often papillated most distally) with hypergranulosis, mimicking verruca vulgaris, which is the main entity in the differential diagnosis. Some cases demonstrate multinucleate keratinocytes in the mid to distal nail bed as well, giving rise to the original name for this entity. Subungual haemorrhage may be present. Distal subungual parakeratosis and hyperkeratosis is characteristic, and it may indent the overlying nail plate undersurface. These features, as well as haemorrhage, can be seen in nail plate clippings.

Blasts are positive for CD3, CD7, and CD5 in 84–97% of cases. CD3 antigen defines T-cell lineage. The intensity of immunohistochemical CD3 expression varies and can be weaker than in mature T cells, especially in cases with only cytoplasmic CD3 expression. CD7 expression is often uniform. The expression of CD5 is variable and may be absent, particularly in more immature precortical stages including an early T-precursor stage. The expression of CD2 and CD10 is common, and CD4 and CD8 are coexpressed in approximately 50% of cases. TdT is present in the majority of cases.

The NPM1::ALK oncogenic tyrosine kinase activates numerous cellular pathways, including the PLCγ, PI3K/AKT, Cdc42/Rac1, JNK/JUN, RAS/ERK/MAPK, mTOR, JAK/STAT3, and STAT5B pathways, to promote cancer. NPM1::ALK controls T-cell identity by epigenetic silencing of many T-cell–associated antigens. Activating mutations of JAK1 and STAT3 lead to constitutive activation of the JAK/STAT3 pathway. Rearrangement of 6p25.3 (harbouring DUSP22) occur in about 30% of cases, and these cases appear to be distinct from other ALK-negative ALCLs in that they lack STAT3 activation, resulting in a DNA hypomethylation state and enhanced immunogenicity. Rearrangement of TP63 occurs as an inversion of 3q28 in about 5% of cases, involving the partner gene TBL1XR1. Copy-number abnormalities, including loss of 17p13 (TP53), are seen in a subset.",

    "microscopic": "The tumour cells show an infiltrative, diffuse growth pattern that can be associated with necrosis. Cases with classic morphology demonstrate a variable number of characteristic hallmark cells that show abundant cytoplasm and large horseshoe-shaped nuclei with multiple nucleoli. The large lymphoma cells show abundant basophilic cytoplasm with occasional vacuoles and large pleomorphic nucleoli with prominent nucleoli. However, the morphological spectrum is broad. Some may have a plasmacytoid appearance with a prominent perinuclear hof and cytoplasmic vacuoles. Systemic ALCLs with cutaneous involvement can show mild epidermotropism and frequently have a component of small cells, like the primary cutaneous small cell pattern of ALCL. The neoplastic cells exhibit strong uniform expression of CD30 highlighting the cell membrane and Golgi region, and they are frequently positive for EMA, especially ALK-positive cases. Immunohistochemistry for ALK highlights the neoplastic cells and is reflective of aberrant expression of ALK secondary to ALK rearrangements. There is variable loss of T-cell–associated antigens. CD2, CD5, and CD4 are most commonly expressed (40–70% of cases), whereas CD3 is negative in > 75% of the cases. CD43 and CD45RO are commonly observed. The tumour cells express cytotoxic markers, including TIA1, granzyme B, and perforin, even when they lack T-cell antigens including CD8. They typically express strong uniform CD25, clusterin, and BCL6. CD15 and PAX5 are almost always absent. The tumour cells may also lack CD45 and T-cell receptor molecules such as βF1 or TCRδ; in addition, occasional cases aberrantly express epithelial markers such as cytokeratins, myeloid antigens such as CD13 and CD33, NK cell markers such as CD56, and stem cell transcriptional factors including SOX2. EBV is negative. ALCLs with DUSP22 rearrangement, however, have a different immunoprofile, in that they frequently lack cytotoxic markers.",

In some cases, the infiltrate is composed of immunoblastic cells. Cytotoxic T cells show striking pagetoid epidermotropism, especially in cases with diffuse generalized lesions, and marked adnexotropism may be seen. Spongiosis can lead to blister formation. In tumours, the infiltrate involves the whole dermis with a patchy or diffuse pattern. Histological signs of cytotoxicity (epidermal, adnexal, and dermal necrosis; haemorrhage; karyorrhexis) are common, while angiocentricity is rare. Rimming of subcutaneous fat spaces has been reported. Most cases show a CD3+, CD8+, CD4− phenotype, but CD8 may be very weak and occasionally negative. βF1+ (TCRβ) expression with cytotoxic markers (TIA1, granzyme B, perforin) and a high Ki-67 proliferation index (> 75%) are expected. A significant subset of cases express CD45RA and lack CD2 and CD5, suggesting a naïve T-cell phenotype. TCRδ and EBV-encoded small RNA (EBER) are negative; CD7 and CD56 are variably expressed.

Some patients present with generalized scaly patches and plaques suggestive of mycosis fungoides, while others present with deep dermal and/or subcutaneous nodules or tumours. Ulceration and rapid evolution can be seen in either presentation. Both patterns may be present in the same patient. Haemophagocytic syndrome and spread to extranodal (visceral) sites cause significant morbidity. Involvement of lymph nodes or bone marrow is uncommon. B symptoms, including fever, night sweats, and weight loss, occur frequently. Findings on CT and PET-CT commonly signal cutaneous and extracutaneous sites of involvement.\n\n---\n\nPCGD-TCLs comprise < 1% of primary cutaneous lymphomas.

    "pathogenesis": "The etiology is unknown. Immune dysfunction associated with chronic antigenic stimulation may play a role in the origin of PCGD-TCL. TR gene chain usage is non-random, suggesting common antigenic drivers.\n\n---\n\nStudies show a heterogeneous genomic landscape, with recurrent mutations of putative driver genes within the JAK/STAT, MAPK, MYC, and chromatin modification pathways, as well as mutations in consensus cancer genes and in tumour suppressor genes. The heterogeneity of PCGD-TCL may be related to different cells of origin with distinct roles in the immunity of their originating skin compartments: delta 1 expression (Vδ1) associates with the superficial cutaneous or mucosal epitheliotropic lymphomas, and delta 2 expression (Vδ2) with the subcutaneous lymphomas. Ultraviolet (UV) radiation signature mutation profiles are more common in delta 1 cases, whereas senescence-related mutagenesis is noted in subcutaneous cases.

Epidermal and intraepithelial (adnexal) infiltrates can be subtle, negligible, or exuberant and pagetoid. Angiotropism is occasionally observed. Dermal involvement may be nodular/perivascular or diffuse. Subcutaneous extension involves lobular and septal sites, with rimming of adipocytes, apoptosis, and karyorrhexis. Additional cytotoxic tissue alteration includes vacuolar interface alteration at the dermoepidermal junction, coagulative necrosis, and angioinvasion. Tumour cells are positive for TCRγ and TCRδ, and negative for TCRβ. A CD3+, CD2+, CD7+/−, CD5− immunophenotype with expression of at least one cytotoxic protein, including granzyme B, perforin, and/or TIA1, is typical.

Frequent chromosomal aberrations are gains of 7q31 and losses at 6q16-q21 and 13q34. NPM1::TYK2 fusion, resulting in constitutive STAT signalling, has been described in sporadic cases of C-ALCL. TYK2 fusions were found in 15%, leading to upregulation of PI3K, MAPK, and G protein pathways. Gene expression profiling revealed high expression of the skin-homing chemokine receptor genes CCR10 and CCR8, possibly explaining skin tropism and infrequent extracutaneous dissemination. The vast majority of C-ALCLs do not show translocations involving the ALK gene at chromosome 2. Rare cases of ALK-positive C-ALCL, including cases with the t(2;5) chromosomal translocation and cases with variant ALK fusion partners have been reported both in children and in adults, usually with an excellent prognosis.",

Ulcerated lesions may show a lymphomatoid papulosis–like histology, with abundant reactive T cells (mostly at lesion borders); admixed histiocytes, eosinophils, and neutrophils; and relatively few CD30-positive cells. In such cases, epidermal hyperplasia may be prominent. The inflammatory background is prominent in the rare neutrophil-rich (pyogenic) and eosinophil-rich patterns. Cases with prominent angiocentric and angiodestructive growth have been described. Rare cases of intralymphatic and intravascular C-ALCL occur. Mucosal lesions show a similar spectrum of features. A more recent sarcomatoid pattern has been reported, which can be confused with mesenchymal skin tumours. The neoplastic cells show variable loss of CD2, CD3, CD5, and CD7, and frequent expression of cytotoxic proteins such as TIA1, perforin, granzyme M, and granzyme B. Some may show a CD4+/CD8−, CD4−/CD8+, or CD4+/CD8+ T-cell phenotype. CD43 expression is usually seen, and most cases are negative for EMA. CD30 is expressed by > 75% of tumour cells. CD15 is expressed in approximately 40% of cases. Cases can be TCRβ+, TCRβ−/TCRδ−, and rarely TCRδ+. LEF1 expression is associated with DUSP22 rearrangement.

The lesions are usually multiple and widespread, suggesting haematogenous dissemination. The skin can be involved via extension from underlying lymphoma and postsurgical procedures such as excisions of lymph nodes involved by BL. Although rare, BL of the skin may mimic herpes zoster infection clinically.\n\n---\n\nCutaneous BL occurs in the setting of HIV infection, as well as in individuals who are otherwise healthy. Only 2% of HIV-positive patients with BL have cutaneous involvement. Nearly all patients with cutaneous BL are male, and adults are affected more commonly than children.",
    "pathogenesis": "Risk factors for endemic BL are Plasmodium falciparum (malaria) and EBV infections. Factors causing BL in low incidence areas, such as Europe, Asia, and South America, are not well understood. The presence or absence of EBV better correlates with distinct biological subtypes of BL. EBV is detected in, at most, 20% of patients with sporadic BL. A subset of cases are related to immunodeficiency. HIV infection is the most common cause of immunodeficiency in patients with BL.\n\n---\n\nAll subtypes of BL carry MYC translocations that probably occur as mistakes in immunoglobulin heavy chain switching or IGV somatic hypermutation. EBV may be essential early in BL pathogenesis by allowing B cells with genetic defects to evade apoptosis. The presence of ID3 and TCF4 mutations in BL results in tonic B-cell receptor signalling.

    "definition": "Intravascular large B-cell lymphoma (IVLBCL) is an aggressive extranodal B-cell lymphoma characterized by the proliferation of large neoplastic B cells virtually restricted to the lumina of blood vessels. The skin is most commonly affected, with diverse dermatological manifestations.",
    "related_terminology": "Not recommended: angiotropic lymphoma; intravascular lymphomatosis.",
    "subtypes": "Cutaneous intravascular large B-cell lymphoma; classic intravascular large B-cell lymphoma; haemophagocytic intravascular large B-cell lymphoma",
    "localization": "IVLBCL may involve virtually any organ, including the skin. Lymph nodes are usually spared.",
    "clinical": "The cutaneous subtype is by definition restricted to the skin at presentation. A wide range of appearances are described, including peau dorange–like lesions, palpable blue-red discolouration, solitary or clustered plaques, and ulcerating nodules and tumours. In the cutaneous subtype, as many as 30% of patients present with systemic symptoms. Most patients present with fever of unknown origin (50–70%), pain, local organ-specific symptoms, or multiorgan failure. The most common site of presentation is the skin (30–40%), but by definition this is associated with the involvement of other organs. A random deep skin biopsy (with the inclusion of subcutaneous fat tissue), even in the absence of clinically overt cutaneous lesions, can be helpful in the diagnosis. Presenting symptoms are dominated by those related to haemophagocytic syndrome, hepatosplenomegaly, and thrombocytopenia (> 75%), and the onset and clinical course are generally rapid. Skin involvement often spares the dermis but may be present in the subcutaneous tissue, even when there is no skin eruption.\n\n---\n\nThe cutaneous subtype occurs in patients with a median age of 59 years, is virtually restricted to women, and is more frequent in countries in the Western Hemisphere. The classic subtype of IVLBCL occurs in adults with a median age of 70 years and has no sex predilection. The haemophagocytic subtype is predominantly reported in Asian countries and has a similar mean age at presentation and age distribution to the classic subtype. Overall, the incidence of the disease is 0.095 cases per 1 million person-years, without important geographical differences, in contrast to the geographical distribution seen in the subtypes.",
    "pathogenesis": "The etiology is unknown. Viral associations are not described.\n\n---\n\nTumour cells are confined to the intravascular space by various mechanisms that allow them to adhere to endothelial cells but render them unable to migrate across the blood vessel wall. MYD88 and CD79B hotspot mutations are reported in 50% and almost 70% of cases, respectively. SETD1B (57%) and HLA-B (57%) mutations are also common. Structural variants affecting CD274 (encoding PDL1) and PDCD1LG2 (encoding PDL2) are reported to be recurrent. Together, the genetic landscape suggests that constitutive NF-κB activation and immune evasion are dominant pathogenetic mechanisms in IVLBCL.",
    "macroscopic": "See Clinical features, above.",
    "microscopic": "Large lymphoid cells with vesicular nuclei and single or multiple prominent nucleoli, often showing mitotic figures, are observed within the lumina of small vessels, especially capillaries. A free-floating (discohesive), cohesive, or marginating/adherent growth pattern may be observed. Rarely, the lymphoid cells can be anaplastic. In the haemophagocytic subtype, a varying infiltrate of non-neoplastic histiocytes with signs of haemophagocytosis is present. Pan–B-cell markers are expressed (CD20, CD79a), often with coexpression of CD5 and PDL1 (CD274; 20–40%). Most cases express IRF4 (MUM1) (75–80%) and have a non–germinal-centre B-cell immunophenotype; however, approximately 13% are CD10-positive.",

Specifically in the skin, IVLBCL should be differentiated from intravascular T-cell–rich lymphoid proliferation, in which large heterogeneously CD30-positive blastoid cells are present in and around lymphatic vessels (see section Reactive T-cell–rich lymphoid proliferations) and from intralymphatic ALK-positive and ALK-negative anaplastic large cell lymphomas that may present with isolated skin localizations.",

Desirable: KSHV/HHV8 negative by latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA) immunohistochemistry; EBV negative by EBV-encoded small RNA (EBER) in situ hybridization.",

    "prognosis_and_prediction": "IVLBCL is an aggressive lymphoma that is often diagnosed late during the disease course, contributing to a poor prognosis.

Xanthelasmas are usually normolipaemic, are large and/or periocular, relapse after surgical ablation, and may reveal ECD. Cutaneous lesions include patches or papulonodules. Other skin lesions may reveal Langerhans cell histiocytosis, which occurs in about 10% of patients. The radiological hallmark of ECD is symmetrical metadiaphysial osteosclerosis of long bones, especially the distal femur and proximal tibia. Retroperitoneal/perinephric infiltration (hairy kidneys) and periaortic soft tissue involvement (coated aorta) are highly suggestive of ECD.\n\n---\n\nECD is a rare disorder of adulthood (median age at diagnosis: 40–60 years; M:F ratio: 3:1).",

MCS may appear concomitantly with systemic disease, often fulfilling criteria for mast cell leukaemia. The clinical presentation varies depending on the location of the mass. As many as 30% of patients present with symptoms of mast cell activation syndrome, including flushing, fever, malaise, diarrhoea, and tachycardia. Serum tryptase levels are frequently increased.\n\n---\n\nMCS is exceedingly rare in humans. Most patients are adults, but children can also be affected. The median age of adults with MCS is 55 years (range: 1–77 years), and there is a slight female predominance (M:F ratio: 1:1.3).",

Only one familial case of MCS has been reported.\n\n---\n\nKIT mutations are rarely demonstrated in MCS, as compared with systemic mastocytosis. KIT is wildtype in 50% of the reported cases, and the canonical KIT p.D816V mutation is found in only 21% of patients. Other KIT mutations have been described in single cases. The paucity of KIT p.D816V mutations suggests that MCS is molecularly distinct from systemic mastocytosis.",

    "microscopic": "MCS manifests as a localized tumour of immature and often highly atypical cells showing an infiltrative and destructive growth pattern. Neoplastic mast cells are difficult to recognize unless special stains are performed. They are usually medium-sized to large pleomorphic or epithelioid cells, with oval or bilobed nuclei. Multinucleated mast cells are sometimes present. Cytoplasmic metachromatic granules can be seen on Giemsa and toluidine blue staining. Increased mitotic activity is sometimes noted, and the tumour is frequently infiltrated by eosinophils. Mast cells with striking nuclear pleomorphism, including bilobed and multilobed forms (promastocytes), have been reported in biopsies of cutaneous childhood-onset mastocytosis and in an adult case. Such a finding does not seem to represent a malignant phenotype and should not be interpreted as cutaneous MCS. Progressive cytological pleomorphism and an unusually high proliferation rate have been reported in an adult with a recurrent cutaneous lesion but without evidence of systemic involvement.",

MTS is a subset of Lynch syndrome, due to mutations affecting the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2. A similar phenotype can also be seen in patients with inherited MUTYH pathogenic mutations.",
    "related_terminology": "None",
    "subtypes": "None",
    "localization": "MTS predisposes individuals to skin and visceral malignancies (see below).",
    "clinical": "Patients with MTS usually develop cutaneous neoplasms and visceral malignancies. MTS-associated cutaneous tumours include sebaceous adenoma, sebaceoma, and sebaceous carcinoma, but not sebaceous hyperplasia. The strongest association is with sebaceous adenoma. Multiple sebaceous neoplasms and sebaceous neoplasms outside the head and neck region are strong indicators. Cystic keratoacanthomas (sometimes multiple and usually showing sebaceous differentiation) in younger patients, at sites without chronic sun exposure, can also be a feature, but these have been less frequently reported. The visceral malignancies of MTS include tumours of the colorectum, endometrium, stomach, small bowel, ovary, gallbladder, hepatobiliary tract, pancreas, urinary tract (renal pelvis, ureter, and bladder), kidney, brain, and prostate; in particular, colonic adenocarcinomas occur in about 50% of patients with MTS. Colonic adenomas are found in about one quarter of patients with MTS.\n\n---\n\nMTS has been identified in at least 9% of Lynch syndrome cases.",
    "pathogenesis": "MTS is caused by a constitutional pathogenic mutation affecting a DNA MMR gene (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, or PMS2). The risk of tumour formation (for visceral malignancies) varies depending on the affected MMR gene, and these risks are set out in the Prospective Lynch Syndrome Database, available from https://plsd.eu/. MSH2 mutations are most commonly associated with the MTS phenotype. MLH1, MSH6, and PMS2 mutations confer a considerably lower risk of cutaneous sebaceous neoplasms.\n\n---\n\nCells lose MMR function when both alleles of a given MMR gene are inactivated. A normal cell in a patient with MTS carries one inherited mutated MMR gene and acquires a second somatic mutation to the corresponding normal MMR allele, rendering that cell deficient for MMR. This deficiency has several important consequences: it leads to an increase in the point mutation rate of MMR-deficient cells, escape from the normal control of apoptosis (conferring gain of a relative growth advantage), increased mutations affecting repetitive DNA sequences (microsatellites) – resulting in microsatellite instability, and abnormal MMR protein expression.",

    "diagnostic_molecular_pathology": "The integrity of the expression of MMR proteins (MLH1, PMS2, MSH2, and MSH6) can be assessed by immunohistochemistry. Preserved expression of all four proteins strongly suggests microsatellite stability, whereas loss of nuclear staining for any of the proteins indicates deficient MMR, suggests the candidate gene, and indicates the need for further testing. Loss of MSH2 alone (or MSH2 and MSH6) suggests a mutation in MSH2. Similarly, loss of MLH1 alone (or MLH1 and PMS2) suggests a mutation or acquired promoter methylation in MLH1. Concomitant loss of MSH2 and MSH6 (or MLH1 and PMS2) reflects the heterodimeric binding and stability relationships in MMR complexes. Approximately 3–10% of tumours with MMR deficiency show preserved protein expression due to mutations that disable protein function but not protein stability. By immunohistochemistry, approximately one half to two thirds of unselected sebaceous neoplasms show deficient DNA MMR protein expression. However, most are sporadic cases, and MMR immunohistochemistry is not routinely used unless there is a history of a previous visceral neoplasm. Rates of MMR protein deficiency vary according to the anatomical site (> 80% outside the head and neck area vs 30–40% in the head and neck) and tumour type (sebaceous adenomas show loss more commonly than sebaceous carcinomas). PCR amplification of discrete microsatellite loci in tumour-extracted DNA is a functional assessment of microsatellite instability and strongly correlates with immunohistochemistry. As many as a third of MTS cases display an apparent microsatellite-stable phenotype on DNA microsatellite instability testing (microsatellite markers developed for colorectal cancer are less sensitive for detecting microsatellite instability in sebaceous neoplasms). Genetic testing and clinical correlation are critical. The positive predictive values for immunohistochemistry alone in the detection of germline DNA MMR defects range from 22% to 37%, although the negative predictive values are as high as 95%, emphasizing a critical need to integrate clinical features (age, family history and personal history of MTS-related cancers, and number of sebaceous tumours) before further testing.",
    "essential_and_desirable_diagnostic_criteria": "MTS is characterized by multiple skin sebaceous neoplasms together with one or more visceral cancers, with these neoplasms showing evidence of MMR deficiency (by MMR immunohistochemistry or microsatellite instability testing), but the definitive MTS / Lynch syndrome diagnosis involves identification of a constitutional/germline MMR gene pathogenic mutation.",

    "subtypes": "None",
    "localization": "Sites of disease include the following: skin – basal cell carcinomas (BCCs), sebaceous cysts / facial milia, palmoplantar pits, epidermal inclusion cysts, multiple naevi; jaw – odontogenic keratocysts (OKCs), cleft palate/lip; bone – congenital anomalies (bifid or splayed ribs, frontal bossing, hypertelorism, scoliosis, flame-shaped lucencies in hands/feet, digit syndactyly, long bone cysts, mandibular prognathism); and CNS – macrocephaly, falx cerebri, tentorium cerebelli and/or sella turcica calcification, medulloblastoma, meningioma, craniopharyngioma. Other manifestations include intratarsal eyelid cysts, fibromas (ovarian and cardiac), and lymphomesenteric cysts.",
    "clinical": "The most frequent manifestations of NBCCS are multiple BCCs (in sun-exposed and non-exposed skin), as well as jaw OKCs, found together in > 90% of affected individuals by the age of 40 years. OKCs most commonly occur in the posterior mandibular ramus, and they may be multifocal when syndrome-associated. The overall prevalence of OKCs in NBCCS is 66–86%, but OKCs have an age-dependent onset, and by the age of 40 years the prevalence is reported to be > 90%. Cysts commonly arise relatively early, at a mean age of 15.5 years, but they may also occur much later in life. Other frequent manifestations include calcification of the falx cerebri, tentorium cerebelli, and/or sella turcica; palmar and plantar pits; and bifid or fused ribs. These findings are considered major diagnostic criteria (see #38440Box 9.03). Minor criteria include medulloblastoma, ovarian fibroma, macrocephaly, congenital facial abnormalities (e.g. cleft lip or palate, frontal bossing, and hypertelorism), skeletal abnormalities (e.g. digit syndactyly), and radiological bone abnormalities (e.g. bridging of the sella turcica, flame cysts in digits, long bone cysts). The clinical features manifest at different ages: macrocephaly and rib anomalies can be detected at birth; medulloblastoma typically develops within the first 3 years of life; OKCs usually manifest after 8 years; and BCCs are usually found after 10 years of age. Radiation treatment of medulloblastoma may induce multiple BCCs, as well as various other tumour types (e.g. meningioma) within the radiation field. NBCCS-associated medulloblastoma usually develops in children aged < 5 years, with the majority identified in patients aged < 2 years, nearly always showing desmoplastic/nodular histopathology. Therefore, it is proposed that desmoplastic/nodular medulloblastoma in young children should serve as a major criterion for the diagnosis of NBCCS. About 1–2% of patients with NBCCS with germline PTCH1 pathogenic sequence variants develop medulloblastoma, compared with about 20% of patients with germline SUFU pathogenic sequence variants.\n\n---\n\nDisease prevalence varies by reporting country. In the United Kingdom, it is 1 case per 18 976 population; in Australia, 1 case per 164 000; in Japan, 1 case per 235 800; and in Italy, 1 case per 256 000. Of 131 children with medulloblastomas in one study, 6% had germline SUFU mutation.",
    "pathogenesis": "NBCCS results from inactivating constitutional sequence variants in the human homologue of the Drosophila segment polarity patched gene (PTCH1) located on chromosome 9q22, SUFU on 10q24, and (in exceptional cases) GPR161 on 1q24.2. Numerous different PTCH1 constitutional pathogenic sequence variants associated with NBCCS have been reported. The detection rate of specific pathogenic variants has increased significantly in recent years, owing to the development of improved methods. The mostly truncating mutations are distributed over the entire PTCH1 coding region, with no mutation hotspots. Missense mutations cluster in a highly conserved region (the sterol-sensing domain), and particularly in transmembrane domain 4. The rate of new PTCH1 pathogenic variants has not been precisely determined, but it is estimated that a high proportion (14–81%) of cases are the result of de novo alterations. SUFU pathogenic sequence variants are detected in only about 5–6% of tested probands, and they are mostly truncating, with most cases inherited from an unaffected, healthy parent; the remaining cases show a de novo variant. Constitutional pathogenic variants in GPR161 have been detected in sonic hedgehog (SHH) subgroup medulloblastomas, suggesting possible NBCCS association.\n\n---\n\nPTCH1 encodes a 12-pass transmembrane protein expressed on many progenitor cell types that functions as a receptor for members of the secreted hedgehog protein family of signalling molecules (SHH, IHH, and DHH) and acts through downstream factors to repress transcription of genes encoding members of pathways active in poorly differentiated cells, such as TGF-β and WNT. PTCH1 controls another transmembrane protein, SMO. In the absence of ligand, PTCH1 inhibits the activity of SMO. Hedgehog signalling takes place in the primary cilium. Binding of hedgehog proteins to PTCH1 can relieve its inhibition of SMO, allowing its translocation to the tip of the primary cilium, which results in the activation and translocation of GLI transcription factors into the cell nucleus and transcription of a set of specific target genes controlling the survival, differentiation, and proliferation of progenitor cells. In vertebrates, this pathway is critically involved in the development of various tissues and organ systems, such as the limbs, gonads, bone, and CNS. SUFU is located downstream in the hedgehog pathway; it has been found to directly interact with GLI proteins and is a negative regulator of hedgehog signalling. PTCH1 and SUFU are classic tumour suppressor genes; the second allele of the mutant gene is lost in most NBCCS-related tumours. The inactivation of PTCH1 or SUFU leads to pathological activation of the SHH signalling pathway.",
    "macroscopic": "Syndromic tumours appear grossly similar to their sporadic counterparts.",
    "microscopic": "Practically all medulloblastomas associated with NBCCS have the morphological features of nodular tumours, including desmoplastic/nodular medulloblastoma and medulloblastoma with extensive nodularity. BCCs do not show any unique histological features, with all subtypes represented, including pigmented subtypes. Basaloid neoplastic cells with peripheral palisading, epithelial–stromal clefting, stromal mucin deposition, and infundibulocystic differentiation are characteristic. NBCCS-associated OKCs are typically multifocal and develop in younger patients than non–syndrome-associated cases. The thin epithelium typically lacks rete ridges and shows a surface with corrugated parakeratin, and the basal cells are palisaded and have hyperchromatic nuclei. Basal budding and microcysts in the wall are more likely in syndromic cysts.",

To detect more complex alterations, additional analysis at the transcript level may be necessary in some cases. Despite improved detection rates, in 15–27% of index cases, neither PTCH1 nor SUFU pathogenic variants can be identified. Because constitutional pathogenic variants are frequent in children younger than 5 years with extensive nodular or desmoplastic/nodular medulloblastomas, genetic counselling should be offered to the families, and early pathogenic variant analysis of PTCH1 and SUFU should be performed. The detection of a constitutional condition is important for appropriate treatment planning to avoid unnecessary radiation therapy.",

    "staging": "Malignancies are staged in accordance with the eighth edition of the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) TNM system.",
    "prognosis_and_prediction": "The life expectancy of patients with NBCCS is 73.4 years, only slightly reduced from unaffected populations (in contrast to some other genetic tumour syndromes); however, there is considerable impact on quality of life. Surveillance guidelines are well established; for SUFU pathogenic sequence variant carriers, they include a recommendation for repeated brain MRI screening for medulloblastoma development within the first 5 years of life. The prognosis of NBCCS-associated medulloblastomas seems to be better than that of sporadic cases, and it has been suggested that therapy protocols be adjusted in patients aged < 5 years with NBCCS, to prevent radiation-induced secondary tumours. Medulloblastoma patients with SUFU germline pathogenic sequence variants are said to have a poor prognosis, although no difference in survival was found between patients with medulloblastoma carrying a PTCH1 versus a SUFU pathogenic variant in other studies. The cumulative BCC burden (> 100 BCCs in about a third of children), requires careful treatment optimization in terms of methods and timing of tumour removal to achieve a good cosmetic result and the best quality-of-life outcomes. Statistical modelling suggests earlier syndrome diagnosis if certain cardinal features are identified and result in genetic testing (i.e. OKCs, BCCs, palmoplantar pits).",

Thus, primaries in the abdominal region typically metastasize to the skin of the abdomen (e.g. Sister Mary Joseph nodule for those involving the periumbilical region), while thoracic tumours typically involve the skin of the chest (e.g. mammary Paget disease involving the nipple and areola). Many primaries may involve the scalp, probably because of the high vascularity of the skin of the scalp.",
    "clinical": "Cutaneous metastases are more common in elderly individuals, although young children may also be affected. In approximately 1–12% of the cases the cutaneous metastasis is the first symptom of the malignancy. Overall, the most common origin is breast cancer in women and melanoma in men, followed by lung, colon, head and neck, and ovarian cancers, and others. Cutaneous metastases commonly manifest as isolated nodules or papules. Less common are large plaques and grouped papules in a zosteriform pattern. Secondary extramammary Paget disease (epidermotropic metastatic carcinoma) may arise as eczematous plaques, most commonly in the genital region (see also section Extramammary Paget disease). Rare cases of breast and salivary gland carcinomas present extensive vascular invasion with an en-cuirasse morphology. Metastases from primary cutaneous lesions may be satellites (within 50 mm of the primary lesion), in transit (between the primary lesion and the regional lymphatic basin), or distant (all others).\n\n---\n\nThe incidence of cutaneous metastasis is 1–10% in autopsies and ranges from 1.2% to 10% in surgical and biopsy specimens. Some of these studies have indicated that cutaneous metastasis is more common in White people than in Asians, although more studies are needed.",
    "pathogenesis": "The cause is that of the primary tumour type.\n\n---\n\nMost cutaneous metastases appear to correspond to haematogenous spread. There is also lymphatic and angiotropic extravascular spread and, rarely, iatrogenic implantation, such as transfer of squamous carcinoma cells through a needle administering an analgesic used both in the tumour and the grafting area. The mechanisms by which some tumours more frequently metastasize to the skin than to other organs is not fully determined. However, as proposed by Dr Paget in 1889 with his seed and soil theory, there is a likely exchange of information between the metastatic tumour cells (seed) and the microenvironment of the recipient tissue (soil).",
    "macroscopic": "Metastases to skin are mostly nodular or erythematous lesions.",
    "microscopic": "The morphology will depend on the primary lesion. In general, metastases present as relatively well-circumscribed lesions involving either the dermis or the subcutaneous tissue. Vascular invasion is usually more frequent than in primary cutaneous lesions. Differential diagnosis The lesions tend to have the same morphology as the primary. Breast carcinoma has a ductular or (less commonly) lobular pattern. Some breast lesions may have prominent vascular invasion (inflammatory carcinoma). Occasionally the stroma is markedly desmoplastic and may resemble a dermatofibroma. Most metastases tend to resemble their primary lesions (e.g. lung adenocarcinoma shows similar a glandular arrangement both in the skin and in the lung, and colon adenocarcinoma metastatic to the skin may show dirty necrosis). However, in some cases the metastases may mimic a primary lesion (e.g. clear cell renal carcinoma metastatic to the skin may be confused with cutaneous xanthomas). Similarly, some metastatic melanomas have a prominent intraepidermal component that even extends beyond the dermal component or appears to be just in situ melanoma, thus mimicking a primary lesion. Immunohistochemistry may be helpful. Metastatic adenocarcinomas to the skin tend to be negative for p63, calretinin, and D2-40. Several authors have proposed algorithms to try to determine the primary tumour in metastasis of unknown origin. Molecular analysis has been proposed to try to detect a genetic signature compatible with an internal malignancy or to provide possible treatments even if the primary origin is unknown.",

Chimeric fusion genes encode transcription factors that serve as master regulators that activate and repress thousands of genes. Expression of these transcription factors in the correct tumour microenvironment is ostensibly required for the development of Ewing sarcoma. Proteins bind both GGAA microsatellites and canonical ETS binding sites in the genome and recruit chromatin regulators. Binding of the fusion proteins to GGAA microsatellites results in transition from a closed to open chromatin state that establishes de novo enhancers which activate genes. Conversely, binding to canonical ETS binding sites displaces wildtype ETS factors and represses gene expression.

Men are more often affected than women. AFXs have been reported in young patients with Li–Fraumeni syndrome with germline mutation of TP53 and xeroderma pigmentosum.",
    "pathogenesis": "A role for ultraviolet (UV) radiation exposure is supported by clinical factors and by the observed associations with Li–Fraumeni syndrome and xeroderma pigmentosum. Some cases have occurred in the field of radiotherapy and in the context of immunosuppression and organ transplantation. Associated trauma has been rarely reported. A role for UV radiation exposure is also supported by evidence of multiple UV radiation–related genetic changes, including UV radiation signature mutations in TP53. Studies, including comparative genomic hybridization, show genomic changes including 9p and 13q deletions, TERT mutations, and many abnormalities in common with pleomorphic dermal sarcoma. AFXs have been seen in Li–Fraumeni syndrome (with germline TP53 mutation) and xeroderma pigmentosum. One patient with xeroderma pigmentosum showed TP53 mutation and germline mutation of CDKN2A (p16INK4a/p14ARF).\n\n---\n\nThe origin of AFX remains unclear, but electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry suggest a histogenesis from undifferentiated dermal mesenchymal cells.",
    "macroscopic": "An often ulcerated, circumscribed tumour as large as 20 mm in diameter is present in the dermis, with a firm cut surface and sometimes with haemorrhage.",
    "microscopic": "A circumscribed dermal tumour is present with no involvement of the subcutis. The neoplasm is typically highly cellular, with striking nuclear enlargement, pleomorphism, and atypia. Mitoses are frequent, with atypical forms. Enlarged spindle or epithelioid cells are seen, some with histiocyte-like appearances. Irregular fascicles may be present with scattered inflammatory cells and occasional haemorrhage. Ulceration is common, sometimes with an epidermal collarette or atrophy. Necrosis is absent in AFX. Plaque-like growth is occasionally seen with a band of cells parallel to the epidermis. These plaque-like lesions may be less well circumscribed. AFX with a spindle cell pattern shows exclusively spindle-shaped cells in fascicles with eosinophilic cytoplasm, vesicular nuclei, and prominent nucleoli. Sometimes the cytological features of this pattern are relatively bland. AFX with a clear cell pattern exhibits cells with clear to foamy cytoplasm and hyperchromatic, pleomorphic nuclei. Glycogen is of limited extent or absent. Further patterns include granular cell, keloidal, myxoid, and sclerotic forms. Regression is sometimes seen, which can be extensive, making diagnosis on a partial biopsy challenging. Pigmented AFX show haemosiderin deposition and haemorrhage. Some AFXs contain osteoclast-like giant cells, which may be multinucleated tumour cells (demonstrating nuclear atypia) or background histiocytes (CD163-positive with bland nuclei). Immunohistochemistry Immunohistochemistry is vital to exclude other malignancies, especially melanoma, leiomyosarcoma, and poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. A metastasis should always be considered. A broad panel of immunostains is essential. In particular, melanocyte markers (e.g. SOX10, S100) and keratinocyte markers (e.g. MNF116, AE1/AE3, 34βE12, p63, p40) should be negative. Included S100-positive Langerhans cells can be numerous and confirmed with CD207 (langerin) or CD1a. Many AFXs are MITF-positive, and occasionally there may be focal expression of melan-A. In some studies, most tumours stain with SMA, but allied desmin or h-caldesmon staining would suggest leiomyosarcoma. Desmin positivity has been reported in AFX, but these tumours may represent leiomyosarcoma, particularly if staining is prominent. CD10 is almost invariably strongly and diffusely expressed in AFX and may be the only positive stain. Although this is nonspecific and can be seen in some melanomas and squamous cell carcinomas, for example, AFX should be diagnosed with great caution if CD10 is absent. CD68 and CD163 are often positive but are of limited diagnostic value and also stain included macrophages. Multinucleated tumour giant cells may non-specifically uptake immunostains including HMB45 and calponin. In vascular-appearing tumours, negative staining for CD34 and ERG may be required to exclude angiosarcoma. Some AFXs express EMA (without evidence of other epithelial marker positivity) and CD31.

TP53 mutations have been identified in 63% of TSC2-mutated PEComas. A small subset of PEComas harbour TFE3 gene fusions, which correlate with strong nuclear immunoreactivity for TFE3, but in skin, TFE3 rearrangements have not been described.",

    "microscopic": "Tumours are dermal-based but often extend into the subcutis. The edges are typically irregular and may show entrapment of dermal collagen. Most PEComas show a nested or trabecular architecture with a distinctive perivascular pattern of growth, with tumour cells radially arranged around vessels, replacing the vessel wall and approaching the endothelium, and are composed of epithelioid cells with granular, palely eosinophilic, or clear cytoplasm and round nuclei with small nucleoli. A mixed epithelioid and spindle cell morphology is less common. Scattered multinucleated cells may be seen, and occasionally mild pleomorphism, but mitotic figures are usually scarce or absent. Almost all reported cases of cutaneous PEComa lack histological features of malignancy (mitotic activity, necrosis, and pleomorphism), with only rare case reports of malignant forms. The presence of malignant features should raise the possibility of a cutaneous metastasis rather than a true primary tumour. So-called angiomyolipomas of skin probably represent hamartomatous or lipomatous neoplasms with a smooth muscle component, rather than being part of the PEComa family of tumours. Immunohistochemistry PEComas characteristically express both melanocytic markers, such as HMB45 (the most sensitive immunomarker), melan-A, and MITF, and muscle markers, such as SMA, desmin, and caldesmon. However, expression of smooth muscle markers is less common in primary cutaneous PEComas than in soft tissue counterparts, occurring in just over 50% of cases. Nuclear expression of S100 is uncommon and usually focal. Tumour cells lack expression of keratins.

    "microscopic": "NNGCTs can be polypoid. Some lesions are gently domed. The lesional cells often extend to the base of the dermis or into the subcutis. The overlying epidermis is usually thin, with epithelial collarettes defining the lateral edges. The granular cells form sheets and are large and oval, with coarse eosinophilic granules. The cellular granularity is due to the accumulation of lysosomes in the cytoplasm of the affected cells. The largest granules are surrounded by clear haloes (pustulo-ovoid bodies of Milian). The nuclei can vary from moderately sized and monomorphic to large, pleomorphic, and heterochromatic. Mitoses can range from few to many (as many as 6 mitoses/mm2), and atypical mitoses can occur. While typically circumscribed, some cases show poorly demarcated deep margins. A few cases have shown lymphatic invasion. Immunohistochemistry The cells of NNGCTs fail to stain for S100 and other neural or melanocytic markers. They usually stain positively for CD68 and CD63 (NKI/C3), probably because of reactivity with lysosomes in the cytoplasm, but such positivity is not lineage-specific; it can also be seen in the cells of many other neoplasms. They are negative for desmin, SMA, and cytokeratin. Differential diagnosis The diagnosis of NNGCT is one of exclusion. While the tumours often resemble conventional granular cell tumour of Schwannian origin, a polypoid configuration, epithelial collarettes, nuclear pleomorphism (including prominent nucleoli), and easily detectable mitoses favour NNGCT. Unlike NNGCTs, conventional granular cell tumours are positive for S100 and SOX10. Granular cell fibrous papules are usually found on the nose, are smaller dome-surfaced lesions, and have nearly clear cytoplasm with paler granules. For NNGCT with cytological atypia and mitotic activity, granular cell patterns of basal cell carcinoma, dermatofibroma, leiomyosarcoma, and dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans are considerations and can usually be distinguished by the expression of lineage-specific markers or by areas in which the conventional aspects of these neoplasms are apparent.",

They can occur at any age, but patients with cutaneous MPNST tend to be older than patients with deep-seated tumours. Patients with NF1 are usually younger at the time of diagnosis than patients with sporadic tumours.\n\n---\n\nCutaneous MPNST is extremely rare, with few reported cases. Only 2% of cutaneous spindle cell malignancies are MPNSTs. Although epithelioid MPNST accounts for < 5% of MPNSTs, this subtype more often involves superficial soft tissues.",
    "pathogenesis": "Conventional MPNST is associated with NF1. Epithelioid MPNST is not associated with NF1 but may arise in association with a schwannoma.\n\n---\n\nGenomic studies of deep-seated conventional MPNSTs demonstrated highly frequent and concurrent inactivating mutations in three pathways: NF1, CDKN2A/CDKN2B, and PRC2 core components (EED or SUZ12), resulting in complete loss of function. In patients with NF1, malignant transformation from pre-existing neurofibromas is often accompanied by progressive genomic alterations that inactivate neurofibromin (NF1), p16/p15 (CDKN2A/CDKN2B), and PRC2 pathways, as well as increased genomic copy-number variations. About 80% of high-grade MPNSTs exhibit complete loss of PRC2 activity and H3 p.K27me3. The loss of H3 p.K27me3 has become a useful diagnostic tool in high-grade MPNST. Given the critical role of PRC2 in development and cell-lineage specification, PRC2 loss may underlie the molecular mechanisms of the histological phenotype of heterologous differentiation in MPNSTs. Given the rarity of cutaneous MPNST, its molecular pathogenesis remains unclear. Epithelioid MPNSTs are distinct from conventional MPNSTs molecularly. SMARCB1 gene inactivation resulting in SMARCB1 loss by immunohistochemistry is observed in approximately 75% of cases. They rarely have genetic alterations in the neurofibromin (NF1), p16/p15 (CDKN2A/CDKN2B), and PRC2 pathways.",

Heterologous elements, as observed in deep-seated tumours, rarely occur. Epithelioid MPNST is composed of plump, epithelioid cells with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm, sometimes embedded in a myxoid or hyalinized matrix, and typically demonstrating a lobulated growth pattern. Immunohistochemistry MPNST may be positive for S100 (< 50% of tumours), SOX10 (< 70%), and GFAP (20–30%). Importantly, expression of S100 and SOX10 is patchy or focal. Diffuse positivity for S100 or SOX10 is not usually compatible with the diagnosis of conventional MPNST. Complete loss of expression of H3 p.K27me3 may be helpful in the diagnosis of MPNST, with high-grade tumours (and radiation-induced MPNST) showing more-frequent loss than low-grade tumours. Epithelioid MPNSTs show strong and diffuse expression of S100 and SOX10 but do not show positivity for melanoma markers. They retain H3 p.K27me3, and most show loss of SMARCB1 expression.

    "clinical": "Schwannomas are slow-growing and occasionally painful. They are typically solitary, except in patients with neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) or schwannomatosis.\n\n---\n\nSporadic schwannomas typically arise in the fourth to sixth decades of life.",
    "pathogenesis": "The etiology of most schwannomas is unknown, although there are established associations with prior irradiation, NF2, and schwannomatosis.\n\n---\n\nConventional schwannomas typically harbour somatic loss-of-function mutations in NF2 and complete or partial loss of chromosome 22, including the wildtype NF2 allele. Other recurrently mutated tumour suppressors include ARID1A/ARID1B (mutated in 29% of cases) and TSC1/TSC2 (in 15%). SH3PXD2A::HTRA1 fusions (found in 10% of cases) activate the MAPK pathway and are mutually exclusive with mutations in the receptor tyrosine kinase gene DDR1 (found in 11% of cases). Germline pathogenic mutations in NF2, LZTR1, SMARCB1, and DGCR8, all located on chromosome 22q, are associated with schwannoma susceptibility. Vestibular schwannomas are the hallmark of NF2. Schwannomatosis 1 and schwannomatosis 2 are due to germline mutations of SMARCB1 (INI1) and LZTR1, respectively. Schwannomas in these patients typically demonstrate loss of two tumour suppressors (NF2 and either LZTR1 or SMARCB1). DGCR8 point mutations are associated with familial multinodular goitre with schwannomatosis.",
    "macroscopic": "Tumours vary in size from a few millimetres to > 80 mm in diameter. Smaller ones are usually white, fusiform, circumscribed, and encapsulated. Larger tumours are lobulated, with greyish-yellowish areas on sectioning, and may rarely contain cystic areas or haemorrhage.",
    "microscopic": "Antoni A areas containing spindle cells with wavy nuclei alternate with hypocellular Antoni B areas, which contain a myxoid matrix and a variable lymphohistiocytic infiltrate. Within the Antoni A areas, parallel rows of nuclei (Verocay bodies) may be seen. Mitoses are rare. In ancient schwannoma, there is degenerative nuclear atypia. Rare subtypes include plexiform, epithelioid, cellular, neuroblastoma-like, and microcystic/reticular schwannoma. Immunohistochemistry Schwannomas are strongly positive for S100 and SOX10 and have an EMA-positive perineurial capsule. Differential diagnosis The differential diagnosis includes neurofibroma, although this often has a lattice-like CD34 staining pattern not seen in schwannomas, as well as a smaller proportion of S100/SOX10-positive cells. It also includes solitary circumscribed neuroma. Epithelioid schwannoma should be distinguished from melanoma, myoepithelioma, and ossifying fibromyxoid tumour; roughly 40% of epithelioid schwannomas show loss of SMARCB1 (INI1) expression. Cellular schwannomas with increased atypia and/or mitotic activity may raise concern for malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumour (MPNST).

    "pathogenesis": "Neurofibromas are the most common peripheral nerve sheath tumours, with the majority occurring sporadically as solitary lesions. Less often, they occur as multiple or numerous tumours in individuals with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). The diffuse cutaneous and plexiform tumours are presumably of congenital origin and, in NF1, the localized cutaneous and localized intraneural neurofibromas begin to appear in the second half of the first decade of life.\n\n---\n\nThe originating cell and nosological classification are controversial. Most neurofibromas are sporadic and solitary. Multiple tumours or the plexiform and diffuse subtypes suggest neurofibromatoses (NF1 and NF2), autosomal dominant disorders caused by genetic alterations in the neurofibromin gene (NF1) on chromosome 17 or in NF2 (encoding merlin [NF2, schwannomin]) on chromosome 22. Many affected patients disease reflects new mutations. NF1 encodes neurofibromin (NF1), a negative regulator of the RAS/MAPK pathway. NF1 mutations cause loss of neurofibromin function, resulting in RAS signalling and MAPK activation. Germline plus somatic mutations (NF1−/−) cause loss of functional neurofibromin. Detailed genotype–phenotype correlations have been documented. Subsequent loss of CDKN2A on chromosome 9p21.3 eventuates in atypical neurofibromatous tumour of uncertain biological potential, which may progress to malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumour (MPNST).",

Neurofibromas are composed of spindle cells with thin, wavy, hyperchromatic nuclei and delicate, pale, eosinophilic cytoplasm. Several patterns have been described: interstitial mucin is prominent in myxoid neurofibroma. Sclerotic neurofibroma has scant spindle cells in a collagenous matrix. Lipomatous neurofibroma has admixed adipocytes. Diffuse neurofibroma infiltrates dermis and subcutis, entrapping adnexa or adipocytes. Plexiform neurofibroma consists of tortuous nerves distended by axons, Schwann cells, and fibroblasts; multivacuolated, mucin-filled cells express CD34 and GLUT1. Melanotic neurofibroma contains variable melanin. Immunohistochemistry Some cells are positive for S100 and SOX10, and for peripherin in thin axons. EMA is negative except in plexiform neurofibroma. A characteristic fingerprint pattern consists of CD34-positive perineurial fibroblasts anastomosing around Schwann cells. Even non-pigmented diffuse neurofibromas may express melanocytic markers.

Cavernous-subtype lesions are composed of dilated vascular channels, with a proliferation of smooth muscle within intervascular spaces. Hybrid lesions have been described.

Glomus tumours may also contain spindled cells resembling smooth muscle (glomangiomyoma) or a branching, haemangiopericytoma-like vasculature (glomangiopericytoma).

Neuroendocrine CHE is characterized by a distinctive admixture of retiform haemangioendothelioma–like areas, epithelioid haemangioendothelioma–like areas, and a component with a striking nested appearance, as well as by expression of neuroendocrine markers (typically synaptophysin). Immunohistochemistry The endothelial markers CD31, CD34, FLI1, and ERG are positive. CHE with YAP1::MAML2 fusions show loss of expression of YAP1 C-terminus. Neuroendocrine CHE is consistently positive for synaptophysin but usually negative for chromogranin. Differential diagnosis The differential diagnosis includes retiform haemangioendothelioma, epithelioid haemangioendothelioma, and angiosarcoma. CHEs showing foci resembling high-grade angiosarcoma are extremely rare, and this diagnosis should be made only after conventional angiosarcoma is rigorously excluded on clinical and morphological grounds.",

    "pathogenesis": "Radiotherapy causes AVL. Total radiation doses range from 37.5 to 60 Gy (mean total radiation dose: 50 Gy).\n\n---\n\nAVL is caused by radiation-induced endothelial cell proliferation, the mechanism for which is uncertain. Mutation analysis has demonstrated that AVLs show a low number of HRAS and TERT mutations, whereas postradiotherapy angiosarcomas show a high frequency of EGFR, TP53, HRAS, and TERT mutations. MYC and FLT4 gene amplifications are not found in AVL.",
    "macroscopic": "Postradiation AVLs appear as small papules or vesicles.",
    "microscopic": "AVL involves the upper and mid dermis and, rarely, the deep dermis. However, in contrast to radiation-induced angiosarcoma, the subcutis is spared. At scanning magnification, an inverted V-shaped architecture is the most common pattern. Less commonly, lesions are poorly defined, lacking the V-shaped pattern and involving only the mid dermis. The proliferation is composed of irregular, branching, anastomosing, thin-walled, empty lymphatic-like vascular channels lined by a single discontinuous layer of endothelial cells with little or no cytological atypia and often displaying hobnail morphology. In places, the vascular channels are back-to-back. Small intravascular papillae are frequently seen. Two histopathological patterns of AVL have been described: the lymphatic type (described above) and the very rare vascular type. In the vascular type, there is proliferation of small capillaries usually lacking a lobular arrangement. Endothelial cells are positive for ERG, CD34, and CD31. They are also positive for podoplanin (D2-40), PROX1, and LYVE1, which gives support to a lymphatic lineage. The Ki-67 proliferation index is low. In lesions of vascular type, endothelial cells express CD31 and CD34, but not lymphatic markers. KSHV/HHV8 is negative. AVL can coexist or progress to radiation-induced angiosarcoma, and superficially sampled radiation-induced angiosarcomas can be indistinguishable from AVLs (see below). Radiation-induced angiosarcoma shows endothelial MYC expression and a high Ki-67 proliferation index (> 10%), whereas AVLs are MYC-negative and show no substantial proliferation. Differential diagnosis The main differential diagnosis is with radiation-induced angiosarcoma. In the latter there is cytological atypia, multilayering, mitotic activity; tumour cells are positive for MYC, and FISH shows MYC amplification. Furthermore, strong cytoplasmic VEGFR3 (FLT4) staining and FLT4 gene amplification by FISH is more frequent in radiation-induced angiosarcoma that in AVL. Hobnail haemangioma can be identical to AVL but the clinical presentation is different and the former is usually associated with prominent haemosiderin deposition.

Low-grade myxofibrosarcoma is hypocellular, prominently myxoid, and composed of mildly atypical spindle-to-stellate cells featuring nuclear hyperchromasia and perivascular cellular condensation with some mucin-containing pseudolipoblasts. The intermediate-grade lesions become more cellular and pleomorphic but lack the solid areas characteristic of high-grade cases. The latter often show necrosis, atypical mitoses, and overlap with undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma. The rare epithelioid subtype typically shows cohesive clusters and/or sheets of epithelioid cells with abundant cytoplasm and vesicular nuclei, simulating carcinoma or melanoma. Immunohistochemistry SMA and/or CD34 reactivity is occasionally seen in myxofibrosarcoma, whereas desmin and S100 are negative.

Intramuscular, intra-articular, and visceral lesions are rare. The most common sites are the forearm, thigh, and upper arm, which account for more than half of all cases; however, nodular fasciitis can involve any part of the body. Well-described rare subtypes include intravascular fasciitis and cranial fasciitis.",
    "clinical": "Nodular fasciitis presents clinically as a relatively rapidly growing subcutaneous mass that enlarges (typically over the course of 3–6 weeks, but in some cases over a period as long as 3 months) and then regresses. It is typically smaller than 20–30 mm in maximal diameter, although an exceptional 100 mm case has been reported. The mass may be tender or painless.\n\n---\n\nNodular fasciitis can occur at any age but has a peak incidence in the third and fourth decades of life, with equal distribution between the sexes.",
    "pathogenesis": "Previously thought to be a reactive process, nodular fasciitis is now recognized as a translocation-driven neoplasm that consistently regresses (transient neoplasia).\n\n---\n\nNodular fasciitis has been shown to harbour a translocation between chromosomes 17 and 22, t(17;22) (p13;q13), which results in MYH9::USP6 fusion and subsequent overexpression of USP6. USP6 encodes a deubiquitinating enzyme with roles in cell trafficking, cell signalling, protein breakdown, and inflammation. MYH9 encodes a non-muscle myosin heavy chain that has roles in cell motility, shape, adhesion, and differentiation. A study of p16, CDK4, MDM2, and p53 implicated the possible involvement of cell-cycle arrest and presumed senescence by p16 in lesional myofibroblastic cells in nodular fasciitis, resulting in its self-limited growth and regression. In addition, USP6 expression creates a negative feedback via TNFSF10 (TRAIL) and interferon-β, resulting in apoptosis and senescence of tumour cells. Rearrangements in USP6 have been shown in approximately 90% of nodular fasciitis cases, and > 65% of these are MYH9::USP6 gene fusions. These are most often detected in earlier (younger) lesions, while the detection of USP6 rearrangements in older lesions can be as low as 20% because of the negative feedback from USP6 expression in tumour cells. Other gene promoters can be substituted for MYH9, sometimes with atypical features: PPP6R3::USP6 and CALD1::USP6 have been reported in exceptional malignant cases, EIF5A::USP6 fusion has been described in a dermal nodular fasciitis of the left forearm with atypical mitosis, and CTNNB1::USP6 fusion was seen in an intraneural nodular fasciitis. USP6 rearrangements have also been reported in aneurysmal bone cyst, fibro-osseous tumour of the digits, and a subgroup of fibroma of tendon sheaths. Tumours in this group (including nodular fasciitis) have morphological and clinical overlap, and it has been suggested that they may represent a spectrum of manifestations of the same disease process in different locations.",
    "macroscopic": "Nodular fasciitis is unencapsulated, with variable circumscribed to infiltrative borders and a fibrous to myxoid and occasionally cystic cut surface.",
    "microscopic": "Nodular fasciitis is composed of fibroblasts and/or myofibroblasts without overt cytological atypia. Mitotic activity can be frequent, but the mitoses are not atypical. Cellularity varies between and within lesions. Feathery tissue culture–like areas are typical of the lesion, but more-cellular areas can form fascicles. The stroma can be myxoid and/or collagenous, even keloidal. The vasculature is rich and fine, resembling granulation tissue. Extravasated red cells are usually seen, often in the tissue culture–like areas. Osteoclastic giant cells and chronic inflammatory cells can be present. Immunohistochemistry Strong expression of SMA by the neoplastic cells is characteristic. Differential diagnosis The histological differential diagnosis depends on the location, the proportion of collagen and myxoid stroma, and cellularity. Collagenous patterns can be mistaken for fibromatosis, collagenous fibroma (desmoplastic fibroblastoma), or granulation tissue. The differential diagnosis also includes neural tumours, nerve sheath tumours, myositis ossificans, proliferative fasciitis, proliferative myositis, and inflammatory myofibroblastic tumours.

Morphological patterns include fat-poor SCL/PL, which is predominantly composed of spindle cells with little to no fat; myxoid SCL/PL, containing abundant myxoid stroma; and pseudoangiomatous SCL/PL, which is composed of dilated, branching, vascular-like spaces and pseudopapillary projections. In addition, a plexiform architecture, focal cartilaginous and osseous metaplasia, and extramedullary haematopoiesis have been reported. Immunohistochemistry The spindle and pleomorphic cells are positive for CD34, with loss of nuclear RB1. S100, SMA, desmin, and STAT6 are typically negative. Differential diagnosis SCL/PLs (particularly fat-poor patterns) must be distinguished from other CD34-positive superficial spindle cell lesions, including myxofibrosarcoma, dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, solitary fibrous tumour, and neurofibroma. PL may mimic atypical lipomatous tumour / well-differentiated liposarcoma and pleomorphic liposarcoma.
