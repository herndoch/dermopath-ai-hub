An analysis of 13 rigorously defined verrucous SCCs from head and neck, anogenital, and extragenital skin using PCR-based HPV detection failed to implicate a causal role for HPV. However, there is a clear association between certain oncogenic HPV types and cutaneous SCC, particularly in the setting of immunosuppression, and the potential role of HPV in verrucous SCC warrants further investigation.

Regional lymph node involvement is the first route of metastasis. Dermoscopy shows distinctive vascular patterns: small dotted, glomerular, hairpin/looped, and/or serpentine vessels.\n\n---\n\nThe incidence of SCC is difficult to establish, but data on non-melanoma skin cancer suggest that there were an estimated 701 000 SCC tumours affecting 430 500 people in the USA in 2006 (assuming that 20% of tumours are SCC). SCC is the second most common form of skin cancer (after basal cell carcinoma) and is more common in men than in women. Most cases occur in sun-exposed skin of elderly individuals, most commonly individuals with lighter skin pigmentation.",
    "pathogenesis": "In addition to ultraviolet (UV) radiation exposure, other factors that have been implicated in the etiology of SCC include chronic immunosuppression, other forms of radiation, topical carcinogens, burn scars, chronic inflammation, sinus tracts, HPV infection, arsenic, and coal tar. Cutaneous SCC was the first occupational cancer to be identified, described in the scrotal skin of British chimney sweeps in 1775 by Percivall Pott. Patients with xeroderma pigmentosum, vitiligo, and albinism are at increased risk of SCC. A recent two-stage genome-wide association study of a large number of SCCs revealed 11 susceptibility loci. Of these, 7 are related to pigmentation: MC1R, ASIP, TYR, SLC45A2, OCA2, IRF4, and BNC2. The other 4 are involved in tumour immune evasion, apoptosis inhibition, or other oncogenic pathways: 11q23.3 (CADM1), 2p22.3, 7p21.1 (AHR), and 9q34.3 (SEC16A).\n\n---\n\nMost UV radiation\u2013related cutaneous SCCs appear to develop through a multistep process in actinic keratoses or in fields of squamous dysplasia. Common mutations involve tumour suppressor genes such as TP53, NOTCH1, and NOTCH2. Activating mutations in genes such as HRAS and KRAS are also frequently involved. UV radiation\u2013induced TP53 mutations probably occur early on in the process. Advanced age, immunosuppression, and environmentally determined defects in the epigenome appear to contribute to impaired elimination of precursors of malignant transformation. Cutaneous SCC probably arises from an epidermal or follicular stem cell.

There are numerous morphological types with distinctive clinical and histological features but similar epidemiology and etiology. All types have in common the presence of nests of basaloid cells with hyperchromatic nuclei and minimal cytoplasm.",
    "clinical": "BCC is most common on the head and neck, followed by the trunk and extremities; the various types show different location predilections and clinical appearances. BCC has also been reported in the perianal and genital region, nail unit, palm, and sole. Dermoscopy improves the sensitivity of clinical diagnosis over visual examination from 67% to 85%.\n\n---\n\nBCC is the most common human malignancy and represents about 80% of all cancers of the skin. Incidence worldwide is rising, with an estimated 4 million new cases worldwide in 2019. The highest rates are seen in Australia, and the lowest in parts of Africa. Over the past decade, the largest increase in incidence occurred in the USA; there were unexpected increases in eastern Asia and tropical Latin America and decreases in Brazil and some African countries. Incidence is inversely related to geographical latitude combined with the pigment status of the population. Risk increases with age, and prolonged life expectancy has contributed to the rise in cases. Although BCC is more common in men overall, a dramatic increase in incidence has been seen in young women in Europe and the USA, resulting in a predominance of women in that age group. This may be due to higher use of indoor tanning and closer attention to skin health with increased medical visits.",
    "pathogenesis": "Patients who are older, are male, have sensitivity to ultraviolet (UV) radiation exposure due to light skin pigmentation, and are exposed to intense intermittent UV radiation are most likely to develop BCC. Chronic arsenic exposure may cause BCC. Radiation treatment, especially in youth, is strongly associated with BCC development. All patients with naevoid BCC syndrome (Gorlin syndrome) develop BCCs; patients with xeroderma pigmentosum, Bazex\u2013Dupr\u00e9\u2013Christol syndrome, and Rombo syndrome are also at risk. Polymorphisms in the MC1R, ASIP, and TYR genes, which regulate melanin production, increase the risk of BCC.\n\n---\n\nThe pathogenesis of BCC involves an interplay between genetic susceptibility and sporadic UV radiation\u2013induced mutations; BCC has the most mutations of any human cancer. Germline mutations in PTCH1 on chromosome 9q22.3-q316 are the cause of BCC in Gorlin syndrome; see section Naevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome (Gorlin syndrome). Loss of heterozygosity of PTCH1 is seen in 58\u201369% of sporadic BCCs; less frequently, SMO and PTCH2 are affected, and most of these are UV radiation signature mutations. Mutant PTCH1 and PTCH1 proteins are receptors for the sonic hedgehog protein, and mutant PTCH1 leads to the increased release of transmembrane protein SMO, which leads to downstream activation of the GLI1 transcriptional pathway that is involved in cell renewal, fate, and survival, and in angiogenesis. Inactivating TP53 alterations are seen in 40\u201365% of sporadic cases; loss of heterozygosity of this gene is mutually exclusive with PTCH1. TP53 alterations cause dysregulation of cell-cycle arrest, apoptosis, and DNA repair.",

Stromal changes include fibromyxoid change, retraction of tumour nests from stroma, calcification, and amyloid deposition. Tumour nests may be colonized by melanocytes and contain melanin pigment.

    "definition": "Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in situ, also known as Bowen disease, is SCC confined to the epidermis and superficial adnexal epithelium, further characterized by full-thickness involvement of the epidermis by dysplastic squamous cells.",
    "clinical": "Patients with SCC in situ usually present with a solitary, slow-growing, scaly, erythematous patch or plaque, which can remain unchanged for many years. Clinical features include crusting, pigmentation, and a verrucous appearance. Dermoscopic features include scale, glomerular vessels, yellow crust, haemorrhage, hypopigmentation, and linear irregular vessels.\n\n---\n\nMost cases arise in the sun-exposed skin of elderly White patients with higher levels of cumulative sun exposure; the median age at presentation is > 60 years. Specific populations at higher risk of SCC in situ include organ transplant recipients on immunosuppressive regimens and populations with long-term exposure to high levels of arsenic in drinking-water. Ultraviolet (UV) radiation exposure from tanning beds has resulted in an increased number of young people presenting with SCC in situ, but the finding of SCC in situ in a young person with minimal sun damage should prompt consideration of arsenic exposure.",
    "pathogenesis": "Most cases of SCC in situ (Bowen disease) are caused by UV radiation exposure, including UVB and UVA radiation exposure from sunlight or tanning beds. Radiotherapy and photochemotherapy are also etiological. High-risk (alpha genus) HPV infection is the major cause of SCC in situ involving the periungual region and genital skin (see the relevant volumes of the WHO classification). Beta genus papillomaviruses may have synergistic effects with UV radiation in the setting of immunosuppression due to organ transplant or HIV infection in causing some cutaneous SCCs in situ. Arsenic ingestion can play a role in SCC in situ in non\u2013sun-exposed skin (see section Arsenical keratosis).\n\n---\n\nThe pathway from actinic keratosis to SCC is characterized by a progressive accumulation of UV radiation signature mutations. Targeted deep sequencing of SCC in situ shows TP53 mutations as an early step in carcinogenesis. Alterations in TP53 or NOTCH1 mutations are found in 94% of SCCs in situ. Progression to invasive SCC is associated with immune dysregulation and with increases in FOXP3-expressing lymphocytes, Langerhans cells, and PDL1 expression.",
    "macroscopic": "See Clinical features, above.",
    "microscopic": "SCC in situ is characterized by full-thickness epidermal dysplasia, involvement of superficial skin adnexal epithelium, and no invasion of the underlying dermis. The stratum corneum is usually hyperparakeratotic, but may demonstrate orthokeratosis. Epidermal thickness is variable, but acanthosis is common. Atypical squamous cells (which are enlarged and pleomorphic and demonstrate hyperchromatic nuclei) replace the full thickness of the epidermis, often showing a loss of polarity. Mitotic figures are increased in number and typically extend to the epidermal surface. The granular layer is frequently absent. The basal layer may be retained (eyeliner sign). Occasional cases demonstrate single or nested atypical squamous cells dispersed throughout the full thickness of the epidermis, imparting a pagetoid appearance. In some cases, cytological atypia is more subtle, and demonstration of full-thickness epidermal staining with Ki-67 is helpful for confirming the diagnosis of SCC in situ. Immunohistochemistry for p16 may be similarly helpful in assessing the degree of dysplasia in genital lesions.",
    "ancillary_studies": null,
    "differential_diagnosis": "SCC in situ with a pagetoid growth pattern must be distinguished (often requiring immunohistochemistry) from mammary and extramammary Paget disease, melanoma in situ, and less common benign simulants such as clonal seborrhoeic keratosis and hidroacanthoma simplex. Actinic keratosis is distinguished from SCC in situ by the lack of full-thickness epidermal dysplasia. Whereas SCC in situ shows confluent parakeratosis, in actinic keratoses the dysplasia spares the epithelium of adnexal structures, correlating with a flag sign of alternating orthokeratosis and parakeratosis. Microinvasive SCC may be difficult to distinguish from SCC in situ, especially when lichenoid inflammation is present, but careful examination of the dermoepidermal junction in SCC reveals jagged, often keratinizing dermal invasive foci.",

Metastases within a 20 mm radius of a primary melanoma are termed satellite metastases, and those farther away but between the regional lymph node basin are called in-transit metastases. Metastatic disease may occur without prior history of melanoma.\n\n---\n\nThe epidemiology is similar to that of the respective primary melanoma.",
    "pathogenesis": "The risk of metastatic disease increases with thickness of the primary.\n\n---\n\nCutaneous melanoma metastasis develops from lymphatic, haematogenous, or perineural spread of the primary lesion, resulting in local, regional, or distant metastases.

Tumour cells are present within adjacent vessels in 5% of cases. Clinicopathological correlation is essential to correctly identify metastatic melanoma. A history of multiple lesions developing in the same locoregional distribution as the primary melanoma is suggestive. Microsatellitosis is a histologically defined pattern of cutaneous metastasis characterized by microscopic foci of metastatic tumour, often angiotropic, in the skin or subcutis, clearly discontinuous from the primary tumour.",

Diffuse meningeal melanocytic tumours frequently occur in the setting of neurocutaneous melanosis. About 10\u201315% of patients with large congenital melanocytic naevi of the skin develop clinical symptoms related to meningeal melanocytosis, and radiological evidence of CNS involvement has been reported in as many as 23% of asymptomatic children with giant congenital naevi. The incidence of neurological involvement, melanoma, and death is significantly associated with the projected adult size of the largest congenital melanocytic naevus and presence of satellite lesions. CT and MRI of meningeal melanocytosis and melanomatosis typically show diffuse thickening and enhancement of the leptomeninges, often with focal or multifocal nodularity. Depending on melanin content, they may have an isodense or hyperintense signal on T1-weighted images and a hypointense signal on T2-weighted images.\n\n---\n\nThe incidence of neurocutaneous melanosis is reported as 0.5\u20132 cases per 100 000 person-years. Melanocytosis mainly affects children, mostly in the context of neurocutaneous melanosis. Melanomatosis has a bimodal age distribution and may manifest in children with or without neurocutaneous melanosis, as well as in adults (mostly in the fourth decade of life).",

Junctional melanocytic naevi exhibit an intraepithelial proliferation of round to oval epithelioid cells and/or oval to cuboidal, intermediate, or lymphocyte-like naevus cells. The nucleoli are usually basophilic without atypia. Mitotic figures are rare. The naevus cells can be arranged as a lentiginous proliferation or as individual, confluent, or irregular nests, without pagetoid spread. Compound melanocytic naevi contain naevus cells within the epithelium and the substantia propria, exhibiting maturation with depth. Solid and cystic surface epithelial invaginations of conjunctival epithelium (with goblet cells) are common. Mitotic activity, if present, appears in the superficial layer. Subepithelial melanocytic naevi arise in the substantia propria, with melanocytes arranged as nests. Subepithelial naevi are more likely to be amelanotic or minimally pigmented. The superficial naevus cells tend to be larger and more polygonal, whereas the deep naevus cells may display neuroid differentiation. Sporadic pleomorphism can be seen. Mitotic figures are generally absent. Solid and cystic conjunctival epithelial invaginations are seen in about half of the cases. Uncommonly, junctional and compound naevi may show disordered architectural alterations intermediate between those of conventional naevi and melanoma, such as increased diameter > 5 mm, peripheral extension of the junctional component, asymmetry, poor circumscription, irregular and confluent junctional nesting, and focal pagetoid spread. Aberrant alterations in the subepithelial component may include diminished or even reversed maturation, nodule formation, and occasional mitotic activity. On occasion, naevi may be inflamed with prominent lymphocytic infiltrates, resembling halo naevi in the skin.",

The most common somatic mutations affect BRAF, NRAS, KIT, NF1, SPRED1, SF3B1, CDKN2A, PTEN, ATRX, and TP53, with frequent amplifications of CCND1, PAK1, GAB2, TERT, CDK4, MDM2, YAP1, and CRKL, and deletions of CDKN2A, PTEN, NF1, and SPRED1.",

The nuclei often have vesicular chromatin and prominent nucleoli. The presence of an adjacent intraepithelial or superficially invasive component of atypical melanocytes supports a mucosal primary. Melanin production is variable but usually at least focally present within both melanoma cells and background macrophages. Vulvar melanoma often shows an intraepidermal component with a confluent nested and lentiginous growth pattern and with pagetoid spread. In contrast, vaginal melanoma typically has a lentiginous growth of single atypical melanocytes in the basal epithelial layer, sometimes with nests or confluent growth.

The neoplastic melanocytes usually have larger, more hyperchromatic nuclei than those of Spitz naevi, with large eosinophilic nucleoli. Large multinucleated melanocytes with bizarre nuclei and foci with necrotic melanocytes may be present. The mitotic count may be increased, and atypical mitoses may be present.

    "microscopic": "Fibroadenoma is a well-circumscribed neoplasm composed of round or elongated, often branching and anastomosing glandular structures surrounded by a paucicellular stroma containing bland spindled or stellate cells, showing low or practically no mitotic activity. When the glandular lumina maintain round or oval configurations, the image is that of a pericanalicular growth pattern, whereas abundant stroma compressing the glandular elements into slit-like structures produces an intracanalicular pattern. Phyllodes tumour shows a growth pattern with leaf-like projections into glandular lumina. The stroma is usually hypercellular, typically with periglandular condensation; cellularity commonly varies within a given neoplasm. Three categories are delineated: benign, low-grade, and high-grade; the grade is defined by stromal atypia. Most vulvar phyllodes tumours are either benign or low-grade; high-grade tumours are extremely rare. Rare features in these tumours include mammary-type ductal lesions, hyperplasia of myoepithelial cells, pseudoangiomatous stromal hyperplasia (PASH), various types of metaplasia in the glandular component and stroma, and lactation-like changes.",

Generally, phyllodes tumours have more-cellular stroma (with variation within a lesion), less regular outlines, and leaf-like projections. Focal connection to the epidermal surface with numerous plasma cells may resemble syringocystadenoma papilliferum. Fibroepithelial foci resembling fibroadenoma may rarely be found in other complex lesions of anogenital mammary-like glands. Fibrocystic disease and other lesions with prominent ductal hyperplasia may be differential diagnoses in a limited specimen. Lactation-like change (secretory hyperplasia) must not be confused with malignancy; the presence of intracytoplasmic vacuoles and intraluminal secretion is the clue to the diagnosis.

Periocular sebaceous carcinoma may be mistaken clinically for benign inflammatory or neoplastic conditions, leading to a delay in diagnosis and to higher morbidity and mortality. Pagetoid sebaceous carcinoma may resemble chronic blepharoconjunctivitis.\n\n---\n\nSebaceous carcinoma develops in older adults, with no sex predilection. The median age at diagnosis is 73 years. The estimated incidence rate per 1 million person-years is approximately 2 cases in White populations, 1 among Asians and Pacific Islanders, and 0.5 in Black populations. Asians and Pacific Islanders appear to be more predisposed to develop a periocular sebaceous carcinoma than other populations.",
    "pathogenesis": "Risk factors include prior radiotherapy, sun exposure, viral infections (HIV and HPV), immunosuppression, and Muir\u2013Torre syndrome, although periocular tumours have almost no association with Muir\u2013Torre syndrome or mismatch repair defects.\n\n---\n\nExtraocular sebaceous carcinomas can be grouped into three molecular-genetic classes based on whether they show an ultraviolet (UV) radiation signature, a paucimutational signature, or a microsatellite instability (MSI) signature. Sebaceous carcinomas with a UV radiation signature carry the highest frequency of mutations, including TP53, RREB1, and NOTCH family mutations. MSI-related sebaceous carcinomas more commonly carry HRAS and KRAS mutations together with TP53, RB1, RREB1, and NOTCH family member mutations. Although defective mismatch repair may be seen in some extraocular sebaceous carcinomas, most of these mutations are somatically acquired, rather than related to Muir\u2013Torre syndrome. Finally, paucimutational sebaceous carcinomas show fewer mutations, but HRAS and NOTCH1 mutations are observed. Periocular sebaceous carcinomas often harbour mutations in TP53, RB1, NOTCH family genes, and ZNF750, as well as gain of the MYC locus. A small subset of cases are related to high-risk HPV infection, and these occur in younger patients, with fewer recurrences.",

More poorly differentiated tumours show a higher N:C ratio, nuclear pleomorphism, prominent nucleoli, basophilic cytoplasm with fewer intracellular vacuoles, and brisk mitotic activity. Sebaceous carcinoma may show basaloid, squamoid (often with keratin pearl formation), spindle cell / sarcomatoid, or neuroendocrine (rippled or organoid growth) features. Invasive tumours can adopt various architectural patterns, including well-circumscribed lobules with pushing borders and variable comedonecrosis, papillary architecture, and highly infiltrative cords; combinations of these patterns are often observed. Of note, whereas sebaceous carcinomas with a UV radiation signature tend to be more poorly differentiated, MSI-related tumours show more well-differentiated histopathological features. Approximately 60% of cases carry an intraepithelial component (pagetoid spread) with extension along and partial replacement of pre-existing pilosebaceous units in the skin, and pseudoglands of Henle in the conjunctiva. Notably, intraepithelial skip lesions may also occur, and sebaceous carcinoma in situ (restricted to the epithelium) may be encountered.",
    "ancillary_studies": "Sebaceous carcinoma shows immunoreactivity for pancytokeratin (and also CK7), adipophilin, EMA, BerEP4, AR, p40, and p63. EMA labelling may enhance the cytoplasmic vacuolization of the tumour cells, but it is often only positive in well-differentiated tumours and lacks specificity. Adipophilin is a more sensitive and specific marker of sebaceous differentiation. Positivity for CD10, DOG1, KIT (CD117), p16, p53, perforin, and factor XIIIa has also been reported in sebaceous carcinoma.",
    "differential_diagnosis": "Sebaceous carcinoma should be excluded when examining basaloid, squamoid, and clear cell epithelial tumours in periocular locations.

These cystic structures are small infundibular cysts, lined by squamous epithelium with a basal layer, an eosinophilic squamous layer of variable thickness, and a well-developed granular layer. The content of the cysts is basophilic and orthokeratotic keratin, similar to the keratin present in the infundibulum of hair follicles. Sometimes the epithelial lining of these cysts is similar to the epithelium of the sebaceous duct, resembling steatocystoma. Finally, some cystic structures of trichoadenoma may be lined by an eosinophilic epithelium with peripheral palisading on a basement membrane; the cyst wall cells show pale pink cytoplasm and keratinization without a previous granular layer resulting in eosinophilic compact orthokeratotic keratin, resembling tiny trichilemmal cysts. Some solid epithelial aggregates of infundibular epithelium are also present in most lesions. Foreign body granulomas are frequently observed in the vicinity of ruptured cystic structures. The stroma of trichoadenoma is much less abundant than the epithelial component and consists of a densely vascularized fibrohistiocytic component and fibrillary collagen.

Syringoma is composed of small ductal structures lined by two layers of epithelial cells embedded in a sclerotic stroma. Infundibular cysts are less numerous in syringoma than in trichoadenoma, and in difficult cases, immunostains for EMA and CEA demonstrate that ductal structures of syringoma express these two markers in the luminal border of the ducts, whereas infundibular cysts of trichoadenoma are negative. Columnar trichoblastoma (formerly desmoplastic trichoepithelioma) with abundant infundibular cysts may resemble trichoadenoma, but it is mostly composed of elongated thin cords of basaloid follicular germinative cells expressing PHLDA1 and a prominent desmoplastic stroma. Microcystic adnexal carcinoma is a malignant and poorly circumscribed neoplasm that often extends to subcutaneous tissue. In superficial areas, the histopathological picture may be similar to that of trichoadenoma, because there are numerous small infundibular cysts, but microcystic adnexal carcinoma is also composed of small round solid aggregates of pale cells and elongated tubular structures in deeper areas.

The overlying skin may look normal, show red or bluish discolouration, or be anetodermic or bullous/lymphangiectatic. Giant lesions and perforating tumours due to the transepidermal elimination of neoplastic cells have been reported. Approximately 5% of patients have multiple pilomatricomas, usually in association with genetic syndromes (see below), although rare non-syndromic cases have been described.\n\n---\n\nPilomatricoma is common, accounting for about 1% of all pathologically diagnosed benign skin lesions. It is the most common non-melanocytic cutaneous tumour excised in children. Pilomatricomas occur across a wide age range (3 months to 93 years) with two peaks of incidence, the first in children and adolescents (between the first and second decade of life) and the second in adults and elderly patients. Nearly half of all cases are diagnosed during the first two decades of life. Most studies have noted a slight female predominance.",
    "pathogenesis": "The majority of pilomatricomas are sporadic; however, pilomatricomas can also be familial or multiple, often in the setting of complex genetic syndromes such as myotonic dystrophy, Gardner syndrome, Turner syndrome, Rubinstein\u2013Taybi syndrome, Goldenhar syndrome, Kabuki syndrome, Sotos syndrome, trisomy 9, gliomatosis cerebri, panhypopituitarism, MUTYH-associated polyposis, and DICER1-related tumour predisposition syndrome.\n\n---\n\nMost pilomatricomas harbour activating mutations in exon 3 of the gene encoding \u03b2-catenin (CTNNB1); the 92 kDa protein encoded by this gene is involved in cell\u2013cell adhesion and in the WNT signalling pathway, which regulates cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. Matrical cells often harbour trisomy of chromosome 18, which carries the antiapoptotic gene BCL2, suggesting that the BCL2 oncoprotein may play a role in the growth and differentiation of pilomatricoma. Germline mutation of PLCD1 contributes to familial multiple pilomatricomas through the PKD / ERK1/2 cascade and TRPV6.",

Peripheral cells are monomorphic, round, small, and deeply basophilic, with indistinct borders, central vesicular nuclei, and prominent nucleoli, and they are mitotically active. These peripheral matrical cells keratinize towards shadow (or ghost or mummified) cells. In rare examples, acantholysis between matrical cells has been described. Shadow cells show distinct borders, eosinophilic cytoplasm, and an empty space where the nucleus was once located. Aggregates of shadow cells show yellow-orange staining and are refractile under polarized light. The transition from matrical cells to shadow cells occurs via intermediate cells characterized by a small, pyknotic, basophilic nucleus and pale cytoplasm. The ratio of matrical cells to shadow cells decreases with increasing age of the lesion. Pilomatricomas are often cystic (most commonly those associated with Gardner syndrome). Calcification and ossification occur in longstanding lesions; in some of these, very few shadow cells remain. The surrounding dermis is fibrotic and often contains foreign body granulomas around shadow cells and calcium deposits. Rare cases are connected to the surface epidermis. Pathological patterns include pigmented and proliferating pilomatricoma (consisting predominantly of mitotically active matrical cells).

    "macroscopic": "The neoplasm is usually an asymmetrical, unencapsulated lesion with irregular borders, involving the dermis and subcutaneous tissue.",
    "microscopic": "The most common growth patterns are papillary, tubular, and solid, which usually indicate an invasive component. The neoplastic cells have abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm, which may be granular and sometimes partly vacuolated. Small lumina or intracytoplasmic vacuoles resulting from abortive ductal differentiation may be present, but decapitation secretion is usually less conspicuous than in an associated in situ component. There is variable nuclear pleomorphism and mitotic activity. Perineural invasion and intravascular involvement may rarely be seen. The in situ component, if present, displays different ductal proliferations, analogous to those in mammary pathology (i.e. typical ductal hyperplasia, atypical ductal hyperplasia, and ductal carcinoma in situ with various patterns). In some tumours, only an invasive component is evident, suggesting either that an in situ lesion has become overgrown by the invasive tumour mass or that the whole neoplasm developed de novo. Rare reported features include conspicuous signet-ring or histiocytoid cells in the invasive component, identical to those seen in signet-ring cell / histiocytoid carcinoma of the periorbital region and other sites.",
    "ancillary_studies": "The neoplastic cells express cytokeratins (including CK7), are usually positive for GCDFP-15, and are variably positive for CEA. S100, EMA, ER, PR, and AR are variably expressed. An in situ component is best identified by an intact peripheral basal/myoepithelial cell layer.",
    "differential_diagnosis": "Mammary ductal carcinoma metastatic to the skin, or involving it by contiguous extension in axillary lesions, can be difficult or even impossible to distinguish from primary cutaneous apocrine carcinoma. However, in situ precursor lesions or evidence of transition from pre-existing apocrine glands, if present, identify the neoplasm as a primary cutaneous tumour. Immunohistochemistry can also be helpful; EGFR (HER1), podoplanin (recognized by D2-40), and p63 are more frequently expressed in primary tumours than in metastatic adenocarcinomas. A panel of several antibodies may have some utility in the distinction; metastatic breast carcinoma is adipophilin+, ER\u2212, PR\u2212, ERBB2 (HER2)+, CK5/6+/\u2212 (weak), and mammaglobin+/\u2212 (weak), whereas primary apocrine carcinoma is adipophilin\u2212, ER+, PR+/\u2212, ERBB2 (HER2)\u2212, CK5/6+/\u2212 (strong and diffuse), and mammaglobin+/\u2212 (strong and diffuse). However, full clinical investigation remains the gold standard. Axillary tumours with histiocytoid cells must be distinguished from invasive lobular carcinoma located in the axillary tail of the mammary gland or ectopic mammary tissue. Malignant tumours essentially representing apocrine carcinoma have been reported to arise from pre-existing benign lesions including spiradenoma, apocrine mixed tumour, and naevus sebaceus of Jadassohn.

Adenoid basal cell carcinoma is distinguished from AdCC by its lack of true ductal structures with myoepithelial cells, the presence of peripheral palisading of neoplastic cells and retraction artefact (often associated with stromal mucin), and at least focal areas of conventional basal cell carcinoma. Cribriform carcinoma is composed of more eosinophilic cells; lacks myoepithelial cells; and focally manifests solid areas and peculiar thin, thread-like intraluminal bridging strands. Rare cases of spiradenoma and spiradenocylindroma display areas resembling AdCC by virtue of a cribriform pattern; homogeneous, eosinophilic, or granular basophilic material; and/or ductal structures with a recognizable peripheral myoepithelial cell layer. The proportion of the AdCC-like pattern varies from 5% to 30% of the tumour volume; therefore, the identification of typical areas of spiradenoma/cylindroma, as well as the absence of nuclear pleomorphism, perineural growth, and increased mitotic activity, facilitates the recognition of this spiradenoma/spiradenocylindroma with an AdCC-like pattern.

    "macroscopic": "The tumours are soft nodules or masses with a gelatinous or mucinous appearance; they are unencapsulated, often poorly circumscribed, and without lobulation.",
    "microscopic": "The stereotypical presentation is that of neoplastic cells arranged in nests, strands, or individual units floating in lakes of extracellular mucin, sometimes separated by variably thick fibrous septa. The histopathological spectrum of primary cutaneous mucinous carcinoma is wide, and it is analogous to that seen in its mammary counterparts, with at least two distinguishable patterns: a more common pure tumour, in which extracellular mucin constitutes > 90%; and a rare mixed form, in which there is an invasive ductal component in addition to the mucinous element. The floating neoplastic epithelial cells are usually relatively monomorphic, although some tumours may show substantial nuclear pleomorphism. Mitoses are generally scarce. An essential feature, which should be looked for, is an in situ component; it is detected in most cases (60\u201370%) and defines the neoplasm as primary cutaneous. In situ lesions usually constitute the minor moiety, and they include (using mammary pathology terminology) ductal hyperplasia, atypical ductal hyperplasia, and ductal carcinoma in situ (cribriform, micropapillary, papillary, and solid), occurring individually or (more rarely) in combination. Some tumours are solid, have a minimal mucinous component, and express neuroendocrine markers (similarly to endocrine mucin-producing sweat gland carcinoma).",

The epithelial neoplastic cells express low-molecular-weight cytokeratins, EMA, CEA, E-cadherin, GATA3, MYB, and GCDFP-15. ER and PR are expressed in most cases. The typical CK7+/CK20\u2212 phenotype can sometimes be useful in the differential diagnosis with metastatic lesions. Neuroendocrine differentiation can be encountered in cutaneous mucinous carcinomas of both pure and mixed types, without a prominent solid component.",
    "differential_diagnosis": "Because histologically identical neoplasms can occur in other organs, primary cutaneous mucinous carcinoma must be differentiated from a metastasis or direct invasion from an underlying extracutaneous neoplasm. The presence of an in situ component qualifies the tumour as primary cutaneous; however, its absence does not necessarily imply an extracutaneous origin, because disrupted myoepithelial cells may no longer be identifiable during disease progression. For such cases, a full clinical workup is needed to establish the origin. Potential pitfalls related to in situ lesions include mammary carcinoma originating from an intradermal lactiferous duct (which could be indistinguishable from a primary cutaneous lesion) and the misinterpretation of normal-looking pre-existing ducts and glands as an in situ lesion. Localization of the tumour on the chest wall and axilla is a strong indicator of mammary origin, whereas microscopic identification of dirty necrosis (disruption of cells resulting in cellular debris) and goblet cell differentiation is a clue to intestinal origin. Rare cases of primary mucinous carcinoma with numerous signet-ring cells, lesions associated with extramammary Paget disease, and lesions in which the mucinous component is scant also pose particular pitfalls. For lesions in which the mucinous component is scant, serial sections or other blocks may reveal the typical mucinous appearance.",

Tumours located on the trunk tend to have a worse outcome than those on the head and neck; however, some trunk lesions involve the axilla, raising the possibility of a misdiagnosed breast primary. Increased rates of recurrence and metastasis have been associated with White ethnicity, younger age at presentation, and large tumour size (> 15 mm).

    "macroscopic": "See Clinical features, above.",
    "microscopic": "EMPSGC typically grows as one or more well-demarcated, expansile nodules with cystic, solid, papillary, pseudopapillary, or cribriform architecture. Tumour cells are polygonal to round, small to intermediate-sized ductal cells, about 1.5 times the size of sweat gland luminal ductal cells. They have amphophilic or bluish cytoplasm and round to oval nuclei with finely stippled chromatin and inconspicuous nucleoli. Mild cytological pleomorphism can be noted in some cases. Small amounts of intracellular and extracellular mucin can be demonstrated by mucicarmine or PAS staining. EMPSGC is frequently seen within dilated eccrine ducts as it spreads between the benign luminal ductal epithelium and the myoepithelial layer. At this (the earliest) stage, the tumour represents carcinoma in situ. Careful evaluation is needed so as not to mistake such a lesion for hidrocystoma. As EMPSGC grows, tumour cells begin to fill the ductal lumina, forming papillae, cribriform arrangements, and/or solid nests, which later become large expansile nodules. The nodules show variable proportions of solid, cystic, papillary, or pseudopapillary architecture. The myoepithelial rim around the larger tumour nests becomes incomplete or lost entirely, consistent with invasive carcinoma with pushing invasion. An infiltrating growth pattern is not seen. The presence of infiltrating tumour nests associated with pools of stromal mucin indicates progression to invasive mucinous adenocarcinoma. Mitotic activity is low, and the Ki-67 proliferation index is seldom greater than 5\u201310%. Tumour necrosis is usually absent. Atypical patterns with increased size, pleomorphism, solid growth, and increased mitotic activity can be encountered. Lesions with even the smallest component of mucinous adenocarcinoma should be diagnosed as invasive mucinous carcinoma.",

INSM1, a most sensitive neuroendocrine marker, is usually positive. All EMPSGCs strongly express ER, PR, and CK7. In contrast, expression of these receptors in apocrine carcinoma is variable. Markers such as p63 or calponin can highlight the myoepithelial layer at the carcinoma in situ stage. EMA shows stronger staining of the surface of the luminal cells.

The remnants of the benign neoplasm are either juxtaposed with the malignant tissue or blend gradually with it. The malignant component shows heterogeneity from case to case and can display the following patterns: adenocarcinoma (apocrine), myoepithelial carcinoma, carcinoma NOS, and sarcomatoid (metaplastic) carcinoma. Adenocarcinoma is composed of sheets of tumour cells arranged in nodules, with glands and papillary structures in which apocrine secretion can be identified. In the absence of convincing apocrine features, the malignant component may be referred to as a carcinoma NOS. Myoepithelial carcinoma is usually diagnosed in lesions in which the pre-existing apocrine mixed tumour displays prominent myoepithelial cell differentiation (i.e. hyaline cell\u2013rich tumours). Like the benign residual tumour cells, the malignant myoepithelial cells have eccentric nuclei and abundant eosinophilic hyaline cytoplasm but display marked pleomorphism, atypical mitoses, and (sometimes) vascular involvement. Sarcomatoid (metaplastic) carcinoma is characterized by a gradual transition from a carcinomatous element to sarcomatoid tissue, which has the appearance of pleomorphic or spindle cell sarcoma NOS or of chondrosarcoma [[Kazakov DV, Michal M, Kacerovska D, et al., editors.

In some cases, the benign neoplasm may have been completely overgrown by the evolving malignant neoplasm, but it is likely that tumours of different lineages were also included in these reports. Approximately 10% of cases of benign apocrine mixed tumour show focal atypical cytological features, including enlarged hyperchromatic cells and multinucleated bizarre cells, which are mainly seen in the areas with squamous cell metaplasia, among hyaline cells, or in foci of oxyphilic metaplasia. However, most of these lesions manifest benign architectural features and follow a benign course. An important diagnostic pitfall is the presence of intravascular tumour deposits in an otherwise benign apocrine mixed tumour, which occurs in 1\u20132% of the neoplasms.

Focal enlarged, atypical-appearing p53-positive cuticular cells can be observed in some poromas. Porocarcinomas, as opposed to poromas, often show diffuse or focal loss of RB1 expression. Poorly differentiated porocarcinoma may be difficult to classify as such, because the typical composition of poroid cells and cuticular cells is often no longer recognizable. Single-cell necrosis in other neoplasms may result in pseudoductal structures that can mimic porocarcinoma. In such cases, the distinction can be made by using CEA and EMA to highlight true ductal structures. Porocarcinoma can manifest variable histopathological features (squamous cell areas, clear cells, etc.) that raise a broad histopathological differential diagnosis. Identifying a parent lesion (i.e. a pre-existing poroma or porocarcinoma in situ) is the best way to avoid misinterpretation in such cases.

A high mitotic index (> 8 mitoses/mm2) and lymphovascular invasion are strongly predictive of death; a high mitotic index also correlates with lymph node involvement.

The neoplasm is composed of multiple interconnected solid nests of epithelial cells with round or oval, hyperchromatic nuclei; inconspicuous or absent nucleoli; granular chromatin; and scant eosinophilic cytoplasm. In addition to the solid areas, there are also small round lumina that are either empty or filled with an eosinophilic substance that gives a homogeneously positive PAS reaction, giving rise to a cribriform pattern. The ratio of solid to cribriform areas varies both within a given neoplasm and among tumours. Common features are larger ductal spaces (sometimes with decapitation secretion); intraluminal micropapillary projections; and thin, thread-like intraluminal bridging strands. Mitotic figures, especially atypical ones, are rare. Individual necrotic cells or foci of necrosis can be evident focally. The small, satellite-like aggregates, composed of a single cell to three or four cells, usually display more-pronounced cytological atypia and nuclear hyperchromasia than the main tumour bulk, but perineural or lymphovascular invasion is not a feature. The stroma is scant and fibrotic, often containing nodular lymphoid aggregates at the periphery of the neoplasm. The neoplastic cells are positive for various cytokeratins (MNF116, AE1/AE3, CAM5.2, CK5/6, and CK7) and BerEP4, and variably positive for KIT. Staining for CEA and EMA highlights the ductal component. CK20, GCDFP-15, CD15, CD31, GATA3, and PR are negative. Immunoreactivity for S100 and p63 is variable. ER can be positive, as can ERBB2.

These dual-type lumina are never seen in cribriform tumour; neither are the deposits of basement membrane material or perineural invasion that are typical of adenoid cystic carcinoma. Cutaneous secretory carcinoma also shows cribriform areas but consists of back-to-back proliferations of tubules and microcysts with conspicuous intraluminal secretions. Coexpression of S100, mammaglobin, STAT5A, and pan-TRK helps to distinguish the neoplasm from cribriform tumour.

The epithelial component is composed of elongated, branched tubules and cystic spaces. These epithelial structures are lined by two cell layers; the peripheral layer is composed of cuboidal myoepithelial cells, and the inner layer is formed by columnar cells. The luminal cell layer may exhibit secretion by decapitation. Cystic areas often contain homogeneous eosinophilic material. Solid aggregates of epithelial cells, as well as isolated polygonal and plasmacytoid epithelial cells, may be also seen.

Small solid epithelial aggregates may be seen. Unusual findings include cribriform areas, clear cell change, hyaline cells, pseudorosette-like structures, prominent osseous metaplasia, and striking intracytoplasmic vacuolization of the neoplastic cells, resulting in physaliphorous-like cells.

The CRTC1::MAML2 fusion gene is not exclusive to hidradenoma; it has also been identified in salivary gland mucoepidermoid carcinoma. This translocation leads to aberrant activation of downstream cAMP/CREB signalling genes. Half to 75% of the cases of hidradenoma have CRTC1::MAML2 fusion, and CRTC3::MAML2 fusions occur more rarely.",

    "microscopic": "Hidradenomas are well-circumscribed dermal neoplasms that may extend into the subcutaneous tissue. Most hidradenomas are solid lobular proliferations, but some contain large cystic spaces filled with homogeneous eosinophilic material. The majority of hidradenomas are composed of pale or clear cells (hence the synonym clear cell hidradenoma). However, other cell types, including polygonal, mucinous, squamoid, oxyphilic/oncocytic, and epidermoid cells, can also be present. The proportion of various cell types and their combinations vary from case to case. The characteristic cytoplasmic clarity is due to abundant intracellular glycogen. The nuclei are small, round, and (usually) eccentrically located. In some examples of hidradenoma, polygonal and epidermoid cells are the most prominent component. Mucinous cells usually appear in small groups and can be recognized by the presence of ample granular bluish cytoplasm. When polygonal cells with ample eosinophilic cytoplasm predominate, hidradenomas have an appearance reminiscent of oncocytoma. Squamoid cells have abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm and are separated by well-defined intercellular bridges; some may keratinize individually and appear as dyskeratotic keratinocytes. Areas of ductal and glandular differentiation are usually present, even in solid neoplasms. These structures are lined by cuboidal cells that elaborate an eosinophilic luminal cuticle. In some cases, glandular structures lined by columnar cells with evidence of secretion by decapitation in the luminal border are also seen. Myoepithelial cells are not present in ductal or glandular structures of hidradenoma. The stroma in hidradenoma is characteristically hyalinized, separating epithelial islands; in lesions of long evolution, this hyalinization may be very marked, leaving only small aggregates of neoplastic cells. Focal cytological atypia can be encountered (hidradenoma with atypical features). Immunostaining for EMA and CEA highlights ductal differentiation; p40, p63, CK5/6, and AE1/AE3 are strongly and diffusely expressed, whereas S100 and SMA are usually negative.",

    "differential_diagnosis": "Poroid hidradenoma has two cell types (poroid and cuticular), both of which are very different from the cells of hidradenoma. In poroid hidradenoma, tubular structures are only seen in the areas of cuticular cells. Like other poromas, poroid hidradenoma frequently shows areas of necrosis en masse. Trichilemmomas consist of pale or clear cells showing signs of trichilemmal differentiation; they often expand the follicular infundibulum and exhibit peripheral palisading surrounded by a thick and prominent basement membrane. In contrast, hidradenoma can connect with pre-existing infundibular structures, but the neoplastic epithelial islands form solid aggregates in the dermis and subcutis. Hidradenomas with a predominantly solid pattern must be distinguished from glomus tumour that shows SMA positivity. Hidradenoma must also be distinguished from a cutaneous metastasis of renal carcinoma, which is characterized by an abundant blood supply, numerous atypical mitoses and areas of necrosis (of both individual neoplastic cells and groups of cells), and extracellular blood lakes. A combination of PAX8 and CAIX staining may be used to solve the differential diagnosis. A particular diagnostic pitfall is posed by cases of histologically benign hidradenomas with lymphatic involvement or evidence of a tumour in a regional lymph node diagnosed simultaneously with the cutaneous primary. Histopathologically, such tumours are well circumscribed and show a lobular and cystic architecture, ductal differentiation, and a hyalinized stroma. There is no significant cytological atypia. Mitoses are rare and necrosis is absent. The lymph nodes show an essentially identical proliferation, with more cellular and extensive cystic changes containing pink amorphous material. Because follow-up of such cases has not revealed any adverse outcomes, it has been suggested that these tumours constitute so-called benign metastases. However, a longer follow-up and more cases are needed to prove or disprove this theory. Complete excision is recommended.",

Although some lesions involute, the extreme pain associated with these tumours has driven patients to amputation as treatment, although retinoids have been used successfully more recently.\n\n---\n\nSubungual keratoacanthoma is a rare tumour that occurs most commonly in middle-aged, light-skinned individuals, in a slightly younger age group than keratoacanthoma elsewhere. STIPs occur in women on average aged between 15 and 35 years.",

A cystic configuration may be evident even in lesions that do not regress. However, distinguishing features include a more vertical orientation, multiple and often clustered dyskeratotic keratinocytes (often numerous in areas of hyperkeratosis), and fewer eosinophils and neutrophils. They may lack fibrosis at their bases. Rarely, calcifying keratinocytes and corneocytes may be observed. The higher expression of p53 and Ki-67 in subungual SCC can be useful in distinguishing it from subungual keratoacanthoma. In STIP, the tumour may displace the nail plate, leading to dystrophy.

In a study evaluating the histopathological patterns of periungual fibromas in patients with tuberous sclerosis, the ungual fibrokeratomas were divided into three histopathological patterns, depending on the ratio of the vascular component to the fibrous component. From most vascular to least vascular, these types are angiomatous, mixed, and fibrous. Generally, immunohistochemistry is not required for the evaluation of ungual fibrokeratoma. A potential pitfall in diagnosis is that cellular angiofibroma and superficial acral fibromyxoma are highlighted with CD34 and may cause diagnostic confusion with other CD34-positive entities.",

    "clinical": "EBVMCU typically manifests as a well-circumscribed, often painful ulcer in mucosal or cutaneous sites, without systemic symptoms, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, or bone marrow involvement. Multifocal lesions within one anatomical region may be seen.\n\n---\n\nNo significant data are currently available on the incidence of EBVMCU. Presentation is generally in elderly patients (> 70 years). EBVMCU occurs in a variety of inborn and acquired immune deficiency/dysregulation contexts, including autoimmunity, therapy-related immune dysregulation (including with methotrexate), HIV infection, post\u2013organ transplantation, and immunosenescence.",
    "pathogenesis": "EBV is present in all cases.\n\n---\n\nThe pathogenesis is for the most part unknown. IG gene rearrangements are detected in 50% of cases and are most likely due to clonal expansions of EBV-infected B cells; rare clonal TR gene rearrangements can occur.",
    "macroscopic": "See Clinical features, above.",
    "microscopic": "A shallow mucosal or cutaneous ulcer is seen with a polymorphous infiltrate ranging from small to large immunoblasts and HRS-like cells. There are admixed plasma cells, histiocytes, and eosinophils. Angioinvasion, thrombosis, and necrosis are often prominent. Vague granulomatous changes can be present. The overlying epithelium may show pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia. The base of the lesion is sharply demarcated by a dense rim of small lymphocytes. One study (of 26 cases) reported that a nearly constant finding is the presence of apoptotic cells with plasmacytoid features. At least four histological patterns have been reported: polymorphous; large cell\u2013rich; classic Hodgkin lymphoma\u2013like; and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma\u2013like. The polymorphic infiltrate consists of a mixture of CD20-positive and CD3-positive lymphoid cells. CD8-positive T cells may predominate in some cases. The atypical large B cells and HRS-like cells are EBV-positive, express B-cell markers (PAX5 dim or strong, OCT2, BOB1), and are frequently positive for CD30 and IRF4 (MUM1), but they only rarely express CD15 or PDL1 (CD274). Small T cells typically form a boundary with the uninvolved adjacent tissue.",

    "differential_diagnosis": "The differential diagnosis of EBVMCU includes polymorphic lymphoproliferative disorders (LPDs), EBV-positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, and classic Hodgkin lymphoma, especially when there are increased large immunoblasts and HRS-like cells. The presence of necrosis and angiocentric infiltrates containing EBV in nasal or oropharyngeal locations may morphologically mimic extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma. The differential diagnoses are summarized in #36578Table 6.21 .",
    "staging": "Formal staging procedures for EBVMCU are not indicated; however, when there is clinical suspicion for more extensive LPDs in a patient with known or suspected immune deficiency disease, including suspected inborn errors of immunity, staging workup should be performed to exclude additional and/or more aggressive LPDs at other sites. Imaging should also be undertaken to exclude mass lesions or deep-seated lesions.",
    "prognosis_and_prediction": "The majority of EBVMCUs regress spontaneously or respond to withdrawal of immunosuppression where immune reconstitution is possible. Localized therapy may be needed in some cases. Occasional cases may have a relapsing and remitting course without progression.",

The distinction becomes arbitrary when both marrow and non-marrow sites are involved, although many treatment protocols use > 25% marrow blasts to define leukaemia.",
    "clinical": "Cutaneous involvement usually occurs at the time of original diagnosis with bone marrow or nodal disease. Solitary leukaemia cutis is exceedingly rare. Patients typically show one or multiple subcutaneous, erythematous to violaceous, firm, painless nodules. Presentation as a maculopapular eruption is rare.\n\n---\n\nT-ALL accounts for about 15% of child\u00adhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia cases; it is more common in adolescents than in younger children, and more common in males than in females. Cutaneous involvement occurs in < 5% of T-ALL/LBL cases.",
    "pathogenesis": "The etiology is unknown; however, one report of T-ALL cases in monozygotic twins suggested an in utero origin of the earliest genetic lesions.\n\n---\n\nT-ALL/LBL develops through a multistep accumulation of genetic and epigenetic alterations in oncogenic and tumour suppressor pathways, ribosomal genes, and deregulated expression of oncogenic microRNAs or long non-coding RNAs leading to altered cell growth, survival, and differentiation.",

T-ALL/LBL rarely shows subtle periadnexal and perivascular distribution, or epidermotropism, which can present a diagnostic challenge. Blasts are small to medium-sized, with high N:C ratios, round to irregular nuclei, finely dispersed chromatin, inconspicuous nucleoli, and scant cytoplasm. A starry-sky pattern has been described. Mitoses and apoptotic debris are associated with a high proliferation rate. The immunophenotype has been extensively studied in bone marrow, peripheral blood, and lymph nodes. Blasts are positive for CD3, CD7, and CD5 in 84\u201397% of cases. CD3 antigen defines T-cell lineage. The intensity of immunohistochemical CD3 expression varies and can be weaker than in mature T cells, especially in cases with only cytoplasmic CD3 expression. CD7 expression is often uniform. The expression of CD5 is variable and may be absent, particularly in more immature precortical stages including an early T-precursor stage. The expression of CD2 and CD10 is common, and CD4 and CD8 are coexpressed in approximately 50% of cases. TdT is present in the majority of cases. Additional markers of immaturity include CD1a, CD34, KIT (CD117), and CD99. TAL1 and LMO2 are frequent. Rarely, heterogeneous expression of CD79a, CD19, CD13, and CD33 has been reported.",

The major fusion partner in ALK-positive ALCL is NPM1, which is involved in the t(2;5)(p23;q35) translocation. The NPM1::ALK oncogenic tyrosine kinase activates numerous cellular pathways, including the PLC\u03b3, PI3K/AKT, Cdc42/Rac1, JNK/JUN, RAS/ERK/MAPK, mTOR, JAK/STAT3, and STAT5B pathways, to promote cancer. NPM1::ALK controls T-cell identity by epigenetic silencing of many T-cell\u2013associated antigens. Activating mutations of JAK1 and STAT3 lead to constitutive activation of the JAK/STAT3 pathway. Rearrangement of 6p25.3 (harbouring DUSP22) occur in about 30% of cases, and these cases appear to be distinct from other ALK-negative ALCLs in that they lack STAT3 activation, resulting in a DNA hypomethylation state and enhanced immunogenicity.

Some may have a plasmacytoid appearance with a prominent perinuclear hof and cytoplasmic vacuoles. Systemic ALCLs with cutaneous involvement can show mild epidermotropism and frequently have a component of small cells, like the primary cutaneous small cell pattern of ALCL. The neoplastic cells exhibit strong uniform expression of CD30 highlighting the cell membrane and Golgi region, and they are frequently positive for EMA, especially ALK-positive cases. Immunohistochemistry for ALK highlights the neoplastic cells and is reflective of aberrant expression of ALK secondary to ALK rearrangements.

Other cytotoxic lymphomas frequently involving the subcutaneous tissue, like gamma-delta and NK/T-cell lymphomas, are excluded from this category.",
    "clinical": "Patients present with tender, non-ulcerated nodules. A sequela of lipoatrophy is occasionally observed. Constitutional symptoms, including fever and malaise, are commonly observed, while approximately 20\u201330% of cases may evolve to haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. A minority of cases present with a single nodule that can trigger similar systemic symptoms.\n\n---\n\nSPTCL is rare. The incidence rate is approximately 1.5 new cases per 10 million person-years in the USA, but it is more common in Asia. There is a female predominance (M:F ratio: 1:3\u20134). The median age at presentation is 35\u201342 years, with a significant number of paediatric and adolescent cases. Autoimmune comorbidities are observed in at least 25% of cases; in particular, lupus erythematosus is a common comorbidity, which may cause difficulties in differentiating SPTCL from an associated lupus panniculitis.",
    "pathogenesis": "Autoimmunity and immune dysregulation may play a role in many cases. The constellation of findings may overlap with lupus erythematosus, raising the differential diagnosis of lupus panniculitis in cases presenting with lymphocyte-rich lobular infiltrates with adipotropic features. SPTCL is not associated with EBV.\n\n---\n\nGermline mutations of HAVCR2 altering the HAVCR2 protein (also known as TIM3), a negative membrane modulator of immune response, have been identified in 25% of patients of European descent and 51\u201385% of patients of Asian descent. Protein misfolding abrogates membrane expression of this negative immune checkpoint, regulating peripheral tolerance. Low levels of T regulatory (Treg) cells (FOXP3+, CCR4+) may lead to immune activation. Various triggers have been proposed for patients without germline mutations, including viral infections and autoimmunity.",

Lipid-laden macrophages are abundant and may show haemophagocytosis. Plasma cells, granulocytes, and plasmacytoid dendritic cells are inconspicuous.

Frequent chromosomal aberrations are gains of 7q31 and losses at 6q16-q21 and 13q34. NPM1::TYK2 fusion, resulting in constitutive STAT signalling, has been described in sporadic cases of C-ALCL. TYK2 fusions were found in 15%, leading to upregulation of PI3K, MAPK, and G protein pathways. Gene expression profiling revealed high expression of the skin-homing chemokine receptor genes CCR10 and CCR8, possibly explaining skin tropism and infrequent extracutaneous dissemination. The vast majority of C-ALCLs do not show translocations involving the ALK gene at chromosome 2. Rare cases of ALK-positive C-ALCL, including cases with the t(2;5) chromosomal translocation and cases with variant ALK fusion partners have been reported both in children and in adults, usually with an excellent prognosis.",

Ulcerated lesions may show a lymphomatoid papulosis\u2013like histology, with abundant reactive T cells (mostly at lesion borders); admixed histiocytes, eosinophils, and neutrophils; and relatively few CD30-positive cells. In such cases, epidermal hyperplasia may be prominent. The inflammatory background is prominent in the rare neutrophil-rich (pyogenic) and eosinophil-rich patterns. Cases with prominent angiocentric and angiodestructive growth have been described. Rare cases of intralymphatic and intravascular C-ALCL occur. Mucosal lesions show a similar spectrum of features. A more recent sarcomatoid pattern has been reported, which can be confused with mesenchymal skin tumours. The neoplastic cells show variable loss of CD2, CD3, CD5, and CD7, and frequent expression of cytotoxic proteins such as TIA1, perforin, granzyme M, and granzyme B. Some may show a CD4+/CD8\u2212, CD4\u2212/CD8+, or CD4+/CD8+ T-cell phenotype. CD43 expression is usually seen, and most cases are negative for EMA. CD30 is expressed by > 75% of tumour cells.

A peripheral blood diagnosis of CLL requires a B-cell count of \u2265 5 \u00d7 109/L with the characteristic morphology and immunophenotype. A tissue-based diagnosis of SLL requires organ enlargement (e.g. lymphadenopathy > 15 mm) and its infiltration by the above neoplastic B cells. Although CLL and SLL represent the same disease, the name SLL is used for cases with < 5 \u00d7 109/L circulating B cells and nodal, splenic, or other extramedullary involvement.",
    "clinical": "Skin involvement by CLL/SLL usually occurs in patients with known CLL; only rarely is CLL/SLL first detected in the skin. Cutaneous lesions can be single, aggregated but localized, or (rarely) generalized. The lesions are erythematous papules, plaques, nodules, or large tumours. CLL/SLL is frequently associated with a second skin disease observed in the same biopsy and may involve sites of herpes simplex virus or varicella zoster virus or other infections, foci of trauma, or surrounding epithelial or non-epithelial malignancies. Rarely, the skin is the site of transformation of CLL to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (Richter transformation).\n\n---\n\nThe incidence of CLL rises with age (median age: 58\u201370 years), and there is a male predominance.

Although rare, BL of the skin may mimic herpes zoster infection clinically.\n\n---\n\nCutaneous BL occurs in the setting of HIV infection, as well as in individuals who are otherwise healthy. Only 2% of HIV-positive patients with BL have cutaneous involvement. Nearly all patients with cutaneous BL are male, and adults are affected more commonly than children.",
    "pathogenesis": "Risk factors for endemic BL are Plasmodium falciparum (malaria) and EBV infections. Factors causing BL in low incidence areas, such as Europe, Asia, and South America, are not well understood. The presence or absence of EBV better correlates with distinct biological subtypes of BL. EBV is detected in, at most, 20% of patients with sporadic BL. A subset of cases are related to immunodeficiency. HIV infection is the most common cause of immunodeficiency in patients with BL.\n\n---\n\nAll subtypes of BL carry MYC translocations that probably occur as mistakes in immunoglobulin heavy chain switching or IGV somatic hypermutation. EBV may be essential early in BL pathogenesis by allowing B cells with genetic defects to evade apoptosis. The presence of ID3 and TCF4 mutations in BL results in tonic B-cell receptor signalling.

A wide range of appearances are described, including peau dorange\u2013like lesions, palpable blue-red discolouration, solitary or clustered plaques, and ulcerating nodules and tumours. In the cutaneous subtype, as many as 30% of patients present with systemic symptoms. Most patients present with fever of unknown origin (50\u201370%), pain, local organ-specific symptoms, or multiorgan failure. The most common site of presentation is the skin (30\u201340%), but by definition this is associated with the involvement of other organs. A random deep skin biopsy (with the inclusion of subcutaneous fat tissue), even in the absence of clinically overt cutaneous lesions, can be helpful in the diagnosis. Presenting symptoms are dominated by those related to haemophagocytic syndrome, hepatosplenomegaly, and thrombocytopenia (> 75%), and the onset and clinical course are generally rapid. Skin involvement often spares the dermis but may be present in the subcutaneous tissue, even when there is no skin eruption.\n\n---\n\nThe cutaneous subtype occurs in patients with a median age of 59 years, is virtually restricted to women, and is more frequent in countries in the Western Hemisphere. The classic subtype of IVLBCL occurs in adults with a median age of 70 years and has no sex predilection. The haemophagocytic subtype is predominantly reported in Asian countries and has a similar mean age at presentation and age distribution to the classic subtype.

Cases associated with myeloid neoplasms may represent a cutaneous manifestation of the underlying and sometimes clonally related malignancy.\n\n---\n\nThe cell of origin was formerly considered to be an immature Langerhans cell or veiled cell.

Blastic morphology is considered to be of prognostic value in IDCT, and there is evidence to suggest the existence of two clinicopathological subgroups among patients with IDCT. Most cases of cutaneous IDCT show complete remission after treatment or even spontaneous regression. As many as 25% of cases may show disease progression and/or malignant behaviour; such cases often show atypical cytological features, a high proliferation index (Ki-67 index: > 20%), or association with other haematological neoplasms.

    "clinical": "Patients display systemic symptoms (e.g. fever) and other symptoms related to local inflammation, fibrosis, and tissue infiltration by histiocytes (e.g. bone pain in nearly 50%). Diabetes insipidus and CNS involvement (e.g. ataxia) are also frequently observed (30\u201340%). Hydroureteronephrosis (ureteric compression) is frequent, while cardiac tamponade is rarer. About 10% of cases are associated with myeloid neoplasms (chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia). The most frequent skin localization of ECD is xanthelasma (25%). Xanthelasmas are usually normolipaemic, are large and/or periocular, relapse after surgical ablation, and may reveal ECD. Cutaneous lesions include patches or papulonodules. Other skin lesions may reveal Langerhans cell histiocytosis, which occurs in about 10% of patients. The radiological hallmark of ECD is symmetrical metadiaphysial osteosclerosis of long bones, especially the distal femur and proximal tibia. Retroperitoneal/perinephric infiltration (hairy kidneys) and periaortic soft tissue involvement (coated aorta) are highly suggestive of ECD.\n\n---\n\nECD is a rare disorder of adulthood (median age at diagnosis: 40\u201360 years; M:F ratio: 3:1).",
    "pathogenesis": "The majority of patients with ECD have a somatic molecular alteration activating the MAPK cell signalling pathway. Clonal haematopoiesis has been described in 40% of patients.\n\n---\n\nECD often displays an oncogenic mutation in MAPK pathway genes, with BRAF p.V600E being observed in 50\u201360% of cases. Other mutations are described in ARAF, NRAS, KRAS, PIK3CA, or MAP2K1 genes. MAPK pathway mutation can also be observed in myeloid progenitors in some patients with ECD. A model with sequential acquisition of driver mutations leading to the development of myeloid neoplasms and ECD from underlying clonal haematopoiesis has been proposed. However, some ECD cases can occur in the absence of clonal haematopoiesis.",

In xanthelasma, Touton cells are more abundant in ECD than in xanthelasmas with other etiologies. Tissue fibrosis is frequently observed and may predominate, leading to a misdiagnosis of reactive fibroinflammatory process. Admixed Langerhans cell histiocytosis may be present in the same biopsy or other tissues, in cases of mixed histiocytosis.

Multinucleated mast cells are sometimes present. Cytoplasmic metachromatic granules can be seen on Giemsa and toluidine blue staining. Increased mitotic activity is sometimes noted, and the tumour is frequently infiltrated by eosinophils. Mast cells with striking nuclear pleomorphism, including bilobed and multilobed forms (promastocytes), have been reported in biopsies of cutaneous childhood-onset mastocytosis and in an adult case. Such a finding does not seem to represent a malignant phenotype and should not be interpreted as cutaneous MCS.

MTS is a subset of Lynch syndrome, due to mutations affecting the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2. A similar phenotype can also be seen in patients with inherited MUTYH pathogenic mutations.",
    "clinical": "Patients with MTS usually develop cutaneous neoplasms and visceral malignancies. MTS-associated cutaneous tumours include sebaceous adenoma, sebaceoma, and sebaceous carcinoma, but not sebaceous hyperplasia. The strongest association is with sebaceous adenoma. Multiple sebaceous neoplasms and sebaceous neoplasms outside the head and neck region are strong indicators. Cystic keratoacanthomas (sometimes multiple and usually showing sebaceous differentiation) in younger patients, at sites without chronic sun exposure, can also be a feature, but these have been less frequently reported. The visceral malignancies of MTS include tumours of the colorectum, endometrium, stomach, small bowel, ovary, gallbladder, hepatobiliary tract, pancreas, urinary tract (renal pelvis, ureter, and bladder), kidney, brain, and prostate; in particular, colonic adenocarcinomas occur in about 50% of patients with MTS. Colonic adenomas are found in about one quarter of patients with MTS.\n\n---\n\nMTS has been identified in at least 9% of Lynch syndrome cases.",
    "pathogenesis": "MTS is caused by a constitutional pathogenic mutation affecting a DNA MMR gene (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, or PMS2). The risk of tumour formation (for visceral malignancies) varies depending on the affected MMR gene, and these risks are set out in the Prospective Lynch Syndrome Database, available from https://plsd.eu/. MSH2 mutations are most commonly associated with the MTS phenotype. MLH1, MSH6, and PMS2 mutations confer a considerably lower risk of cutaneous sebaceous neoplasms.\n\n---\n\nCells lose MMR function when both alleles of a given MMR gene are inactivated. A normal cell in a patient with MTS carries one inherited mutated MMR gene and acquires a second somatic mutation to the corresponding normal MMR allele, rendering that cell deficient for MMR. This deficiency has several important consequences: it leads to an increase in the point mutation rate of MMR-deficient cells, escape from the normal control of apoptosis (conferring gain of a relative growth advantage), increased mutations affecting repetitive DNA sequences (microsatellites) \u2013 resulting in microsatellite instability, and abnormal MMR protein expression.",

    "diagnostic_molecular_pathology": "The integrity of the expression of MMR proteins (MLH1, PMS2, MSH2, and MSH6) can be assessed by immunohistochemistry. Preserved expression of all four proteins strongly suggests microsatellite stability, whereas loss of nuclear staining for any of the proteins indicates deficient MMR, suggests the candidate gene, and indicates the need for further testing. Loss of MSH2 alone (or MSH2 and MSH6) suggests a mutation in MSH2. Similarly, loss of MLH1 alone (or MLH1 and PMS2) suggests a mutation or acquired promoter methylation in MLH1. Concomitant loss of MSH2 and MSH6 (or MLH1 and PMS2) reflects the heterodimeric binding and stability relationships in MMR complexes. Approximately 3\u201310% of tumours with MMR deficiency show preserved protein expression due to mutations that disable protein function but not protein stability. By immunohistochemistry, approximately one half to two thirds of unselected sebaceous neoplasms show deficient DNA MMR protein expression. However, most are sporadic cases, and MMR immunohistochemistry is not routinely used unless there is a history of a previous visceral neoplasm. Rates of MMR protein deficiency vary according to the anatomical site (> 80% outside the head and neck area vs 30\u201340% in the head and neck) and tumour type (sebaceous adenomas show loss more commonly than sebaceous carcinomas). PCR amplification of discrete microsatellite loci in tumour-extracted DNA is a functional assessment of microsatellite instability and strongly correlates with immunohistochemistry. As many as a third of MTS cases display an apparent microsatellite-stable phenotype on DNA microsatellite instability testing (microsatellite markers developed for colorectal cancer are less sensitive for detecting microsatellite instability in sebaceous neoplasms). Genetic testing and clinical correlation are critical. The positive predictive values for immunohistochemistry alone in the detection of germline DNA MMR defects range from 22% to 37%, although the negative predictive values are as high as 95%, emphasizing a critical need to integrate clinical features (age, family history and personal history of MTS-related cancers, and number of sebaceous tumours) before further testing.",

    "definition": "Naevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome (NBCCS) is an autosomal dominant disease associated with developmental disorders and predisposition to benign and malignant tumours.",
    "clinical": "The most frequent manifestations of NBCCS are multiple BCCs (in sun-exposed and non-exposed skin), as well as jaw OKCs, found together in > 90% of affected individuals by the age of 40 years. OKCs most commonly occur in the posterior mandibular ramus, and they may be multifocal when syndrome-associated. The overall prevalence of OKCs in NBCCS is 66\u201386%, but OKCs have an age-dependent onset, and by the age of 40 years the prevalence is reported to be > 90%. Cysts commonly arise relatively early, at a mean age of 15.5 years, but they may also occur much later in life. Other frequent manifestations include calcification of the falx cerebri, tentorium cerebelli, and/or sella turcica; palmar and plantar pits; and bifid or fused ribs. These findings are considered major diagnostic criteria (see #38440Box 9.03). Minor criteria include medulloblastoma, ovarian fibroma, macrocephaly, congenital facial abnormalities (e.g. cleft lip or palate, frontal bossing, and hypertelorism), skeletal abnormalities (e.g. digit syndactyly), and radiological bone abnormalities (e.g. bridging of the sella turcica, flame cysts in digits, long bone cysts). The clinical features manifest at different ages: macrocephaly and rib anomalies can be detected at birth; medulloblastoma typically develops within the first 3 years of life; OKCs usually manifest after 8 years; and BCCs are usually found after 10 years of age. Radiation treatment of medulloblastoma may induce multiple BCCs, as well as various other tumour types (e.g. meningioma) within the radiation field. NBCCS-associated medulloblastoma usually develops in children aged < 5 years, with the majority identified in patients aged < 2 years, nearly always showing desmoplastic/nodular histopathology. Therefore, it is proposed that desmoplastic/nodular medulloblastoma in young children should serve as a major criterion for the diagnosis of NBCCS. About 1\u20132% of patients with NBCCS with germline PTCH1 pathogenic sequence variants develop medulloblastoma, compared with about 20% of patients with germline SUFU pathogenic sequence variants.\n\n---\n\nDisease prevalence varies by reporting country. In the United Kingdom, it is 1 case per 18 976 population; in Australia, 1 case per 164 000; in Japan, 1 case per 235 800; and in Italy, 1 case per 256 000. Of 131 children with medulloblastomas in one study, 6% had germline SUFU mutation.",
    "pathogenesis": "NBCCS results from inactivating constitutional sequence variants in the human homologue of the Drosophila segment polarity patched gene (PTCH1) located on chromosome 9q22, SUFU on 10q24, and (in exceptional cases) GPR161 on 1q24.2. Numerous different PTCH1 constitutional pathogenic sequence variants associated with NBCCS have been reported. The detection rate of specific pathogenic variants has increased significantly in recent years, owing to the development of improved methods. The mostly truncating mutations are distributed over the entire PTCH1 coding region, with no mutation hotspots. Missense mutations cluster in a highly conserved region (the sterol-sensing domain), and particularly in transmembrane domain 4. The rate of new PTCH1 pathogenic variants has not been precisely determined, but it is estimated that a high proportion (14\u201381%) of cases are the result of de novo alterations. SUFU pathogenic sequence variants are detected in only about 5\u20136% of tested probands, and they are mostly truncating, with most cases inherited from an unaffected, healthy parent; the remaining cases show a de novo variant. Constitutional pathogenic variants in GPR161 have been detected in sonic hedgehog (SHH) subgroup medulloblastomas, suggesting possible NBCCS association.\n\n---\n\nPTCH1 encodes a 12-pass transmembrane protein expressed on many progenitor cell types that functions as a receptor for members of the secreted hedgehog protein family of signalling molecules (SHH, IHH, and DHH) and acts through downstream factors to repress transcription of genes encoding members of pathways active in poorly differentiated cells, such as TGF-\u03b2 and WNT. PTCH1 controls another transmembrane protein, SMO. In the absence of ligand, PTCH1 inhibits the activity of SMO. Hedgehog signalling takes place in the primary cilium. Binding of hedgehog proteins to PTCH1 can relieve its inhibition of SMO, allowing its translocation to the tip of the primary cilium, which results in the activation and translocation of GLI transcription factors into the cell nucleus and transcription of a set of specific target genes controlling the survival, differentiation, and proliferation of progenitor cells. In vertebrates, this pathway is critically involved in the development of various tissues and organ systems, such as the limbs, gonads, bone, and CNS. SUFU is located downstream in the hedgehog pathway; it has been found to directly interact with GLI proteins and is a negative regulator of hedgehog signalling. PTCH1 and SUFU are classic tumour suppressor genes; the second allele of the mutant gene is lost in most NBCCS-related tumours. The inactivation of PTCH1 or SUFU leads to pathological activation of the SHH signalling pathway.",
    "macroscopic": "Syndromic tumours appear grossly similar to their sporadic counterparts.",
    "microscopic": "Practically all medulloblastomas associated with NBCCS have the morphological features of nodular tumours, including desmoplastic/nodular medulloblastoma and medulloblastoma with extensive nodularity. BCCs do not show any unique histological features, with all subtypes represented, including pigmented subtypes. Basaloid neoplastic cells with peripheral palisading, epithelial\u2013stromal clefting, stromal mucin deposition, and infundibulocystic differentiation are characteristic. NBCCS-associated OKCs are typically multifocal and develop in younger patients than non\u2013syndrome-associated cases. The thin epithelium typically lacks rete ridges and shows a surface with corrugated parakeratin, and the basal cells are palisaded and have hyperchromatic nuclei. Basal budding and microcysts in the wall are more likely in syndromic cysts.",

Surveillance guidelines are well established; for SUFU pathogenic sequence variant carriers, they include a recommendation for repeated brain MRI screening for medulloblastoma development within the first 5 years of life. The prognosis of NBCCS-associated medulloblastomas seems to be better than that of sporadic cases, and it has been suggested that therapy protocols be adjusted in patients aged < 5 years with NBCCS, to prevent radiation-induced secondary tumours. Medulloblastoma patients with SUFU germline pathogenic sequence variants are said to have a poor prognosis, although no difference in survival was found between patients with medulloblastoma carrying a PTCH1 versus a SUFU pathogenic variant in other studies. The cumulative BCC burden (> 100 BCCs in about a third of children), requires careful treatment optimization in terms of methods and timing of tumour removal to achieve a good cosmetic result and the best quality-of-life outcomes. Statistical modelling suggests earlier syndrome diagnosis if certain cardinal features are identified and result in genetic testing (i.e. OKCs, BCCs, palmoplantar pits).",

To detect more complex alterations, additional analysis at the transcript level may be necessary in some cases. Despite improved detection rates, in 15\u201327% of index cases, neither PTCH1 nor SUFU pathogenic variants can be identified. Because constitutional pathogenic variants are frequent in children younger than 5 years with extensive nodular or desmoplastic/nodular medulloblastomas, genetic counselling should be offered to the families, and early pathogenic variant analysis of PTCH1 and SUFU should be performed.

In approximately 1\u201312% of the cases the cutaneous metastasis is the first symptom of the malignancy. Overall, the most common origin is breast cancer in women and melanoma in men, followed by lung, colon, head and neck, and ovarian cancers, and others. Cutaneous metastases commonly manifest as isolated nodules or papules. Less common are large plaques and grouped papules in a zosteriform pattern. Secondary extramammary Paget disease (epidermotropic metastatic carcinoma) may arise as eczematous plaques, most commonly in the genital region (see also section Extramammary Paget disease). Rare cases of breast and salivary gland carcinomas present extensive vascular invasion with an en-cuirasse morphology. Metastases from primary cutaneous lesions may be satellites (within 50 mm of the primary lesion), in transit (between the primary lesion and the regional lymphatic basin), or distant (all others).\n\n---\n\nThe incidence of cutaneous metastasis is 1\u201310% in autopsies and ranges from 1.2% to 10% in surgical and biopsy specimens. Some of these studies have indicated that cutaneous metastasis is more common in White people than in Asians, although more studies are needed.",
    "pathogenesis": "The cause is that of the primary tumour type.\n\n---\n\nMost cutaneous metastases appear to correspond to haematogenous spread. There is also lymphatic and angiotropic extravascular spread and, rarely, iatrogenic implantation, such as transfer of squamous carcinoma cells through a needle administering an analgesic used both in the tumour and the grafting area. The mechanisms by which some tumours more frequently metastasize to the skin than to other organs is not fully determined. However, as proposed by Dr Paget in 1889 with his seed and soil theory, there is a likely exchange of information between the metastatic tumour cells (seed) and the microenvironment of the recipient tissue (soil).",
    "macroscopic": "Metastases to skin are mostly nodular or erythematous lesions.",
    "microscopic": "The morphology will depend on the primary lesion. In general, metastases present as relatively well-circumscribed lesions involving either the dermis or the subcutaneous tissue. Vascular invasion is usually more frequent than in primary cutaneous lesions. Differential diagnosis The lesions tend to have the same morphology as the primary. Breast carcinoma has a ductular or (less commonly) lobular pattern. Some breast lesions may have prominent vascular invasion (inflammatory carcinoma). Occasionally the stroma is markedly desmoplastic and may resemble a dermatofibroma. Most metastases tend to resemble their primary lesions (e.g. lung adenocarcinoma shows similar a glandular arrangement both in the skin and in the lung, and colon adenocarcinoma metastatic to the skin may show dirty necrosis). However, in some cases the metastases may mimic a primary lesion (e.g. clear cell renal carcinoma metastatic to the skin may be confused with cutaneous xanthomas). Similarly, some metastatic melanomas have a prominent intraepidermal component that even extends beyond the dermal component or appears to be just in situ melanoma, thus mimicking a primary lesion. Immunohistochemistry may be helpful. Metastatic adenocarcinomas to the skin tend to be negative for p63, calretinin, and D2-40. Several authors have proposed algorithms to try to determine the primary tumour in metastasis of unknown origin. Molecular analysis has been proposed to try to detect a genetic signature compatible with an internal malignancy or to provide possible treatments even if the primary origin is unknown.",

    "pathogenesis": "The majority of cases appear to be sporadic, but germline mutations in genes predisposing to cancer have been described.\n\n---\n\nAs with their deeper counterpart, the pathogenesis of cutaneous Ewing sarcomas is driven by transcription factors encoded by chimeric FET::ETS gene fusions, most commonly EWSR1::FLI1 and EWSR1::ERG. Chimeric fusion genes encode transcription factors that serve as master regulators that activate and repress thousands of genes. Expression of these transcription factors in the correct tumour microenvironment is ostensibly required for the development of Ewing sarcoma. Proteins bind both GGAA microsatellites and canonical ETS binding sites in the genome and recruit chromatin regulators. Binding of the fusion proteins to GGAA microsatellites results in transition from a closed to open chromatin state that establishes de novo enhancers which activate genes. Conversely, binding to canonical ETS binding sites displaces wildtype ETS factors and represses gene expression.

Although there are no specific clinical features, the diagnosis can sometimes be suspected from the context and lack of pigmentation or features pointing to a diagnosis of basal or squamous cell carcinoma.\n\n---\n\nThe tumours are rare, mostly occurring in sun-damaged skin of elderly White patients, especially those living in areas of high solar radiation. Men are more often affected than women. AFXs have been reported in young patients with Li\u2013Fraumeni syndrome with germline mutation of TP53 and xeroderma pigmentosum.",
    "pathogenesis": "A role for ultraviolet (UV) radiation exposure is supported by clinical factors and by the observed associations with Li\u2013Fraumeni syndrome and xeroderma pigmentosum. Some cases have occurred in the field of radiotherapy and in the context of immunosuppression and organ transplantation. Associated trauma has been rarely reported. A role for UV radiation exposure is also supported by evidence of multiple UV radiation\u2013related genetic changes, including UV radiation signature mutations in TP53. Studies, including comparative genomic hybridization, show genomic changes including 9p and 13q deletions, TERT mutations, and many abnormalities in common with pleomorphic dermal sarcoma. AFXs have been seen in Li\u2013Fraumeni syndrome (with germline TP53 mutation) and xeroderma pigmentosum. One patient with xeroderma pigmentosum showed TP53 mutation and germline mutation of CDKN2A (p16INK4a/p14ARF).\n\n---\n\nThe origin of AFX remains unclear, but electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry suggest a histogenesis from undifferentiated dermal mesenchymal cells.",
    "macroscopic": "An often ulcerated, circumscribed tumour as large as 20 mm in diameter is present in the dermis, with a firm cut surface and sometimes with haemorrhage.",
    "microscopic": "A circumscribed dermal tumour is present with no involvement of the subcutis. The neoplasm is typically highly cellular, with striking nuclear enlargement, pleomorphism, and atypia. Mitoses are frequent, with atypical forms. Enlarged spindle or epithelioid cells are seen, some with histiocyte-like appearances. Irregular fascicles may be present with scattered inflammatory cells and occasional haemorrhage. Ulceration is common, sometimes with an epidermal collarette or atrophy. Necrosis is absent in AFX. Plaque-like growth is occasionally seen with a band of cells parallel to the epidermis. These plaque-like lesions may be less well circumscribed. AFX with a spindle cell pattern shows exclusively spindle-shaped cells in fascicles with eosinophilic cytoplasm, vesicular nuclei, and prominent nucleoli. Sometimes the cytological features of this pattern are relatively bland. AFX with a clear cell pattern exhibits cells with clear to foamy cytoplasm and hyperchromatic, pleomorphic nuclei. Glycogen is of limited extent or absent. Further patterns include granular cell, keloidal, myxoid, and sclerotic forms. Regression is sometimes seen, which can be extensive, making diagnosis on a partial biopsy challenging. Pigmented AFX show haemosiderin deposition and haemorrhage. Some AFXs contain osteoclast-like giant cells, which may be multinucleated tumour cells (demonstrating nuclear atypia) or background histiocytes (CD163-positive with bland nuclei). Immunohistochemistry Immunohistochemistry is vital to exclude other malignancies, especially melanoma, leiomyosarcoma, and poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. A metastasis should always be considered. A broad panel of immunostains is essential. In particular, melanocyte markers (e.g. SOX10, S100) and keratinocyte markers (e.g. MNF116, AE1/AE3, 34\u03b2E12, p63, p40) should be negative. Included S100-positive Langerhans cells can be numerous and confirmed with CD207 (langerin) or CD1a. Many AFXs are MITF-positive, and occasionally there may be focal expression of melan-A. In some studies, most tumours stain with SMA, but allied desmin or h-caldesmon staining would suggest leiomyosarcoma. Desmin positivity has been reported in AFX, but these tumours may represent leiomyosarcoma, particularly if staining is prominent. CD10 is almost invariably strongly and diffusely expressed in AFX and may be the only positive stain. Although this is nonspecific and can be seen in some melanomas and squamous cell carcinomas, for example, AFX should be diagnosed with great caution if CD10 is absent. CD68 and CD163 are often positive but are of limited diagnostic value and also stain included macrophages. Multinucleated tumour giant cells may non-specifically uptake immunostains including HMB45 and calponin. In vascular-appearing tumours, negative staining for CD34 and ERG may be required to exclude angiosarcoma. Some AFXs express EMA (without evidence of other epithelial marker positivity) and CD31.

Nearly one third of cases have a completely solid appearance. Mitotic figures are few, although atypical mitotic figures may be noted. A variable number of pleomorphic cells may be present. Cellular atypia and increased mitotic figures are not associated with an aggressive clinical outcome. One pattern of angiomatoid fibrous histiocytoma is characterized by small blue round cells, resembling an undifferentiated round cell sarcoma. A myxoid pattern has also been described. Immunohistochemistry Most tumours express SOX9. Nearly 50% of cases are immunoreactive for desmin. These tumours are consistently negative for MYOD1 and myogenin.

A mixed epithelioid and spindle cell morphology is less common. Scattered multinucleated cells may be seen, and occasionally mild pleomorphism, but mitotic figures are usually scarce or absent. Almost all reported cases of cutaneous PEComa lack histological features of malignancy (mitotic activity, necrosis, and pleomorphism), with only rare case reports of malignant forms. The presence of malignant features should raise the possibility of a cutaneous metastasis rather than a true primary tumour. So-called angiomyolipomas of skin probably represent hamartomatous or lipomatous neoplasms with a smooth muscle component, rather than being part of the PEComa family of tumours. Immunohistochemistry PEComas characteristically express both melanocytic markers, such as HMB45 (the most sensitive immunomarker), melan-A, and MITF, and muscle markers, such as SMA, desmin, and caldesmon. However, expression of smooth muscle markers is less common in primary cutaneous PEComas than in soft tissue counterparts, occurring in just over 50% of cases. Nuclear expression of S100 is uncommon and usually focal. Tumour cells lack expression of keratins.

    "macroscopic": "See Clinical features, above.",
    "microscopic": "NNGCTs can be polypoid. Some lesions are gently domed. The lesional cells often extend to the base of the dermis or into the subcutis. The overlying epidermis is usually thin, with epithelial collarettes defining the lateral edges. The granular cells form sheets and are large and oval, with coarse eosinophilic granules. The cellular granularity is due to the accumulation of lysosomes in the cytoplasm of the affected cells. The largest granules are surrounded by clear haloes (pustulo-ovoid bodies of Milian). The nuclei can vary from moderately sized and monomorphic to large, pleomorphic, and heterochromatic. Mitoses can range from few to many (as many as 6 mitoses/mm2), and atypical mitoses can occur. While typically circumscribed, some cases show poorly demarcated deep margins. A few cases have shown lymphatic invasion. Immunohistochemistry The cells of NNGCTs fail to stain for S100 and other neural or melanocytic markers. They usually stain positively for CD68 and CD63 (NKI/C3), probably because of reactivity with lysosomes in the cytoplasm, but such positivity is not lineage-specific; it can also be seen in the cells of many other neoplasms. They are negative for desmin, SMA, and cytokeratin. Differential diagnosis The diagnosis of NNGCT is one of exclusion. While the tumours often resemble conventional granular cell tumour of Schwannian origin, a polypoid configuration, epithelial collarettes, nuclear pleomorphism (including prominent nucleoli), and easily detectable mitoses favour NNGCT. Unlike NNGCTs, conventional granular cell tumours are positive for S100 and SOX10. Granular cell fibrous papules are usually found on the nose, are smaller dome-surfaced lesions, and have nearly clear cytoplasm with paler granules. For NNGCT with cytological atypia and mitotic activity, granular cell patterns of basal cell carcinoma, dermatofibroma, leiomyosarcoma, and dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans are considerations and can usually be distinguished by the expression of lineage-specific markers or by areas in which the conventional aspects of these neoplasms are apparent.",

Cutaneous MPNST is less frequently associated with NF1 than deep MPNST.",
    "clinical": "The most common symptoms are localized swelling and pain, but many cases are asymptomatic. They can occur at any age, but patients with cutaneous MPNST tend to be older than patients with deep-seated tumours. Patients with NF1 are usually younger at the time of diagnosis than patients with sporadic tumours.\n\n---\n\nCutaneous MPNST is extremely rare, with few reported cases. Only 2% of cutaneous spindle cell malignancies are MPNSTs. Although epithelioid MPNST accounts for < 5% of MPNSTs, this subtype more often involves superficial soft tissues.",
    "pathogenesis": "Conventional MPNST is associated with NF1. Epithelioid MPNST is not associated with NF1 but may arise in association with a schwannoma.\n\n---\n\nGenomic studies of deep-seated conventional MPNSTs demonstrated highly frequent and concurrent inactivating mutations in three pathways: NF1, CDKN2A/CDKN2B, and PRC2 core components (EED or SUZ12), resulting in complete loss of function. In patients with NF1, malignant transformation from pre-existing neurofibromas is often accompanied by progressive genomic alterations that inactivate neurofibromin (NF1), p16/p15 (CDKN2A/CDKN2B), and PRC2 pathways, as well as increased genomic copy-number variations. About 80% of high-grade MPNSTs exhibit complete loss of PRC2 activity and H3 p.K27me3. The loss of H3 p.K27me3 has become a useful diagnostic tool in high-grade MPNST. Given the critical role of PRC2 in development and cell-lineage specification, PRC2 loss may underlie the molecular mechanisms of the histological phenotype of heterologous differentiation in MPNSTs. Given the rarity of cutaneous MPNST, its molecular pathogenesis remains unclear. Epithelioid MPNSTs are distinct from conventional MPNSTs molecularly. SMARCB1 gene inactivation resulting in SMARCB1 loss by immunohistochemistry is observed in approximately 75% of cases. They rarely have genetic alterations in the neurofibromin (NF1), p16/p15 (CDKN2A/CDKN2B), and PRC2 pathways.",

Epithelioid MPNST is composed of plump, epithelioid cells with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm, sometimes embedded in a myxoid or hyalinized matrix, and typically demonstrating a lobulated growth pattern. Immunohistochemistry MPNST may be positive for S100 (< 50% of tumours), SOX10 (< 70%), and GFAP (20\u201330%). Importantly, expression of S100 and SOX10 is patchy or focal. Diffuse positivity for S100 or SOX10 is not usually compatible with the diagnosis of conventional MPNST. Complete loss of expression of H3 p.K27me3 may be helpful in the diagnosis of MPNST, with high-grade tumours (and radiation-induced MPNST) showing more-frequent loss than low-grade tumours. Epithelioid MPNSTs show strong and diffuse expression of S100 and SOX10 but do not show positivity for melanoma markers. They retain H3 p.K27me3, and most show loss of SMARCB1 expression.

The diffuse cutaneous and plexiform tumours are presumably of congenital origin and, in NF1, the localized cutaneous and localized intraneural neurofibromas begin to appear in the second half of the first decade of life.\n\n---\n\nThe originating cell and nosological classification are controversial. Most neurofibromas are sporadic and solitary. Multiple tumours or the plexiform and diffuse subtypes suggest neurofibromatoses (NF1 and NF2), autosomal dominant disorders caused by genetic alterations in the neurofibromin gene (NF1) on chromosome 17 or in NF2 (encoding merlin [NF2, schwannomin]) on chromosome 22. Many affected patients disease reflects new mutations. NF1 encodes neurofibromin (NF1), a negative regulator of the RAS/MAPK pathway. NF1 mutations cause loss of neurofibromin function, resulting in RAS signalling and MAPK activation. Germline plus somatic mutations (NF1\u2212/\u2212) cause loss of functional neurofibromin. Detailed genotype\u2013phenotype correlations have been documented.

Plexiform neurofibroma consists of tortuous nerves distended by axons, Schwann cells, and fibroblasts; multivacuolated, mucin-filled cells express CD34 and GLUT1. Melanotic neurofibroma contains variable melanin. Immunohistochemistry Some cells are positive for S100 and SOX10, and for peripherin in thin axons. EMA is negative except in plexiform neurofibroma. A characteristic fingerprint pattern consists of CD34-positive perineurial fibroblasts anastomosing around Schwann cells. Even non-pigmented diffuse neurofibromas may express melanocytic markers.

Immunohistochemistry The endothelial markers CD31, CD34, FLI1, and ERG are positive. CHE with YAP1::MAML2 fusions show loss of expression of YAP1 C-terminus. Neuroendocrine CHE is consistently positive for synaptophysin but usually negative for chromogranin.

    "definition": "Postradiation atypical vascular lesion (AVL) is a benign vascular proliferation arising in irradiated skin, with histopathological features mimicking angiosarcoma.",
    "clinical": "Patients typically present with papules, small vesicles, or erythematous ecchymotic plaques with prominent telangiectasia.\n\n---\n\nMost patients are elderly women. The latency period varies, but it is usually 2\u20133 years after radiotherapy.",
    "pathogenesis": "Radiotherapy causes AVL. Total radiation doses range from 37.5 to 60 Gy (mean total radiation dose: 50 Gy).\n\n---\n\nAVL is caused by radiation-induced endothelial cell proliferation, the mechanism for which is uncertain. Mutation analysis has demonstrated that AVLs show a low number of HRAS and TERT mutations, whereas postradiotherapy angiosarcomas show a high frequency of EGFR, TP53, HRAS, and TERT mutations. MYC and FLT4 gene amplifications are not found in AVL.",
    "macroscopic": "Postradiation AVLs appear as small papules or vesicles.",
    "microscopic": "AVL involves the upper and mid dermis and, rarely, the deep dermis. However, in contrast to radiation-induced angiosarcoma, the subcutis is spared. At scanning magnification, an inverted V-shaped architecture is the most common pattern. Less commonly, lesions are poorly defined, lacking the V-shaped pattern and involving only the mid dermis. The proliferation is composed of irregular, branching, anastomosing, thin-walled, empty lymphatic-like vascular channels lined by a single discontinuous layer of endothelial cells with little or no cytological atypia and often displaying hobnail morphology. In places, the vascular channels are back-to-back. Small intravascular papillae are frequently seen. Two histopathological patterns of AVL have been described: the lymphatic type (described above) and the very rare vascular type. In the vascular type, there is proliferation of small capillaries usually lacking a lobular arrangement. Endothelial cells are positive for ERG, CD34, and CD31. They are also positive for podoplanin (D2-40), PROX1, and LYVE1, which gives support to a lymphatic lineage. The Ki-67 proliferation index is low. In lesions of vascular type, endothelial cells express CD31 and CD34, but not lymphatic markers. KSHV/HHV8 is negative. AVL can coexist or progress to radiation-induced angiosarcoma, and superficially sampled radiation-induced angiosarcomas can be indistinguishable from AVLs (see below). Radiation-induced angiosarcoma shows endothelial MYC expression and a high Ki-67 proliferation index (> 10%), whereas AVLs are MYC-negative and show no substantial proliferation. Differential diagnosis The main differential diagnosis is with radiation-induced angiosarcoma. In the latter there is cytological atypia, multilayering, mitotic activity; tumour cells are positive for MYC, and FISH shows MYC amplification. Furthermore, strong cytoplasmic VEGFR3 (FLT4) staining and FLT4 gene amplification by FISH is more frequent in radiation-induced angiosarcoma that in AVL. Hobnail haemangioma can be identical to AVL but the clinical presentation is different and the former is usually associated with prominent haemosiderin deposition. Other differential diagnoses include lymphatic malformations, benign lymphangioendothelioma, and Kaposi sarcoma.",

The capillaries are interspersed with immature dendritic-type cells and arranged in lobules separated by delicate fibrous septa or normal intervening stroma. Perineural extension is common, and the feeding and draining vessels may be quite large. During active involution, the lesional capillaries become variably dilated and congested, and gradually disappear. The basement membranes thicken and show apoptotic dust, and the pericapillary mast cells increase in number. Nearing end-stage, the tumour lobules are replaced by loose fibrous or fibrofatty stroma containing a few residual ghost capillaries composed of thickened multilayered rinds of basement membrane material with little or no cellular lining. The endothelial cells show a complex immunophenotype shared only by placental capillaries, including positivity for GLUT1, LeY, CD15, CCR6, IDO1, and IGF2.

    "entity_name": "Nodular fasciitis",
    "definition": "Nodular fasciitis is a self-limited benign myofibroblastic/fibroblastic neoplasm, classically occurring in the subcutis, arranged in a disorganized tissue culture\u2013like pattern; it usually harbours USP6 rearrangement.",
    "clinical": "Nodular fasciitis presents clinically as a relatively rapidly growing subcutaneous mass that enlarges (typically over the course of 3\u20136 weeks, but in some cases over a period as long as 3 months) and then regresses. It is typically smaller than 20\u201330 mm in maximal diameter, although an exceptional 100 mm case has been reported. The mass may be tender or painless.\n\n---\n\nNodular fasciitis can occur at any age but has a peak incidence in the third and fourth decades of life, with equal distribution between the sexes.",
    "pathogenesis": "Previously thought to be a reactive process, nodular fasciitis is now recognized as a translocation-driven neoplasm that consistently regresses (transient neoplasia).\n\n---\n\nNodular fasciitis has been shown to harbour a translocation between chromosomes 17 and 22, t(17;22) (p13;q13), which results in MYH9::USP6 fusion and subsequent overexpression of USP6. USP6 encodes a deubiquitinating enzyme with roles in cell trafficking, cell signalling, protein breakdown, and inflammation. MYH9 encodes a non-muscle myosin heavy chain that has roles in cell motility, shape, adhesion, and differentiation. A study of p16, CDK4, MDM2, and p53 implicated the possible involvement of cell-cycle arrest and presumed senescence by p16 in lesional myofibroblastic cells in nodular fasciitis, resulting in its self-limited growth and regression. In addition, USP6 expression creates a negative feedback via TNFSF10 (TRAIL) and interferon-\u03b2, resulting in apoptosis and senescence of tumour cells. Rearrangements in USP6 have been shown in approximately 90% of nodular fasciitis cases, and > 65% of these are MYH9::USP6 gene fusions. These are most often detected in earlier (younger) lesions, while the detection of USP6 rearrangements in older lesions can be as low as 20% because of the negative feedback from USP6 expression in tumour cells. Other gene promoters can be substituted for MYH9, sometimes with atypical features: PPP6R3::USP6 and CALD1::USP6 have been reported in exceptional malignant cases, EIF5A::USP6 fusion has been described in a dermal nodular fasciitis of the left forearm with atypical mitosis, and CTNNB1::USP6 fusion was seen in an intraneural nodular fasciitis. USP6 rearrangements have also been reported in aneurysmal bone cyst, fibro-osseous tumour of the digits, and a subgroup of fibroma of tendon sheaths. Tumours in this group (including nodular fasciitis) have morphological and clinical overlap, and it has been suggested that they may represent a spectrum of manifestations of the same disease process in different locations.",
    "macroscopic": "Nodular fasciitis is unencapsulated, with variable circumscribed to infiltrative borders and a fibrous to myxoid and occasionally cystic cut surface.",
    "microscopic": "Nodular fasciitis is composed of fibroblasts and/or myofibroblasts without overt cytological atypia. Mitotic activity can be frequent, but the mitoses are not atypical. Cellularity varies between and within lesions. Feathery tissue culture\u2013like areas are typical of the lesion, but more-cellular areas can form fascicles. The stroma can be myxoid and/or collagenous, even keloidal. The vasculature is rich and fine, resembling granulation tissue. Extravasated red cells are usually seen, often in the tissue culture\u2013like areas. Osteoclastic giant cells and chronic inflammatory cells can be present. Immunohistochemistry Strong expression of SMA by the neoplastic cells is characteristic. Differential diagnosis The histological differential diagnosis depends on the location, the proportion of collagen and myxoid stroma, and cellularity. Collagenous patterns can be mistaken for fibromatosis, collagenous fibroma (desmoplastic fibroblastoma), or granulation tissue. The differential diagnosis also includes neural tumours, nerve sheath tumours, myositis ossificans, proliferative fasciitis, proliferative myositis, and inflammatory myofibroblastic tumours.
